Up until now, Wall Street had been hesitant to give much credence to the idea that Starbucks’ embroilment in a firestorm of social, cultural and geopolitical issues could impact its financial performance. Instead, most analysts wrote off previous boycott threats as “noise,” or said labor organizing only impacts a fraction of stores. But Tuesday’s results, with the company posting its slowest sales growth in a year, shows we’ve entered a new era. A generational shift is underway among consumers, and when companies step on the wrong side of certain hot-button issues, their customers are reacting. Gen Z in particular has shown they are willing to do more than just post video rants on TikTok, actually putting their money where their mouth is.

直到现在，华尔街还不太相信星巴克卷入社会、文化和地缘政治问题的风暴会影响其财务业绩。相反，大多数分析师把之前的抵制威胁说成是 "噪音"，或者说劳工组织只影响了一小部分门店。但周二的财报显示，该公司的销售额增长速度为一年来最慢，这表明我们已经进入了一个新时代。消费者正在发生世代交替，当公司在某些热点问题上站错队时，他们的顾客就会做出反应。尤其是 Z 世代，他们愿意做的不仅仅是在 TikTok 上发布咆哮视频，而是真正把钱花在刀刃上。

Consumers are losing trust in mainstream media and increasingly turning to their social feeds for information; more than three-quarters of Gen Z adults and two-thirds of millennials rely on social media for news, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. On places like TikTok and Instagram, chatter about a business, whether accurate or not, travels fast and tempers can be quick to inflame.

根据标准普尔全球市场情报公司（S&P Global Market Intelligence）的数据，超过四分之三的 Z 世代成年人和三分之二的千禧一代依靠社交媒体获取信息。在 TikTok 和 Instagram 等社交媒体上，有关企业的言论，无论准确与否，都会迅速传播，脾气也会很快暴躁起来。

This seems like progress. Corporations and Wall Street long put these kinds of social issues into the bucket of reputational risk. It’s time to start accepting that they’re risks to the bottom line, too.

这似乎是一种进步。长期以来，企业和华尔街都把这类社会问题归为声誉风险。现在是时候开始承认它们也是底线风险了。
