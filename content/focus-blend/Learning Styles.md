Pashler and his colleagues agree: “An obvious point is that the optimal instructional method is likely to vary across disciplines” (p. 116). In other words, it makes disciplinary sense to include kinesthetic activities in sculpture and anatomy courses, reading/writing activities in literature and history courses, visual activities in geography and engineering courses, and auditory activities in music, foreign language, and speech courses. Obvious or not, it aligns teaching and learning with the contours of the subject matter, without limiting the potential abilities of the learners.

Pashler 及其同事对此表示赞同："一个显而易见的问题是，不同学科的最佳教学方法可能会有所不同"（第 116 页）。换句话说，在雕塑和解剖课程中加入动觉活动，在文学和历史课程中加入阅读/写作活动，在地理和工程课程中加入视觉活动，在音乐、外语和演讲课程中加入听觉活动，这些都是有学科意义的。无论这是否显而易见，它都能使教学与学科内容保持一致，同时又不限制学习者的潜在能力。
