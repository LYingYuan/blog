Competent people are a source of pain to higher levels of management, because they don't just say "yes boss", they will tend to point out the risks of flying blind, offer a better solution than what was recently clubbed at the board of directors meeting, and have ethical guardrails regarding what chemicals to put in the product, how to treat coworkers, etc. They are brilliant at their tasks, but have opinions that go beyond their designated area, they are expensive and demanding. And they usually end up getting the can, with or without a severance pay. And the incompetent, but "yes boss"-employee gets the promotion instead.

能干的人是高层管理者的痛苦之源，因为他们不会只说 "好的，老板"，他们往往会指出盲目行事的风险，提出比最近在董事会上讨论的更好的解决方案，并在产品中添加什么化学物质、如何对待同事等方面制定道德准则。他们在工作中表现出色，但他们的意见超出了他们的指定范围，他们既昂贵又苛刻。不管有没有离职金，他们最终通常都会被解雇。而不称职但 "是老板 "的员工则会得到晋升。
