Ireland had arguably the world’s largest housing bubble and crash in the 2000s, with prices quadrupling in the decade to 2007, even while supply soared, before crashing by more than half between 2007 and 2012. Unsurprisingly, this extreme experience has been the subject of much research. Housing has become a critical economic, social and political issue in many cities across the high-income world. At its worst, it even threatens the very concept of living standards in high-income countries, gobbling up a third or even half of the disposable incomes of individuals and households in some locations. But it wasn’t always like this. Adjusting for inflation, the price of housing in high-income countries underwent ups and downs in the century to the 1960s but the trend was largely stable. Though the timing varies by country, it has only been in the last half-century or so that the price of housing has shot up like a hockey stick.

爱尔兰在 2000 年代经历了可以说是世界上最大的房地产泡沫和崩盘，在 2007 年之前的十年间，房价翻了两番，甚至在供应量激增的同时，房价在 2007 年至 2012 年间暴跌了一半以上。毫不奇怪，这一极端经历一直是许多研究的主题。在高收入国家的许多城市，住房问题已成为一个关键的经济、社会和政治问题。在最糟糕的情况下，它甚至威胁到高收入国家生活水平的概念本身，在某些地方吞噬了个人和家庭可支配收入的三分之一甚至一半。但情况并非总是如此。扣除通货膨胀因素后，高收入国家的住房价格在 20 世纪 60 年代之前的一个世纪里起起伏伏，但趋势基本稳定。虽然不同国家的时间有所不同，但住房价格像曲棍球棒一样飙升只是在最近半个多世纪的事情。

But many of these arguments rely on simplistic myths about what happened. Contrary to many of these claims, Ireland was not a story of overbuilding caused by laissez-faire policy, or an experience that defied standard economics. Ireland built very few ghost towns – housing excesses, where they occurred, were a product of government tax policy, rather than irrational markets. And supply and demand perform very well in explaining the trends. Failing to understand these basics will mean we are susceptible to making the same mistakes all over again.

但其中许多论点都是基于对所发生事件的简单化臆想。与许多人的说法相反，爱尔兰并不是一个由自由放任政策造成的过度建设的故事，也不是一个违背标准经济学的经历。爱尔兰很少建造鬼城--即使出现住房过剩，也是政府税收政策而非理性市场的产物。供求关系很好地解释了这些趋势。如果不了解这些基本原理，我们就很容易重蹈覆辙。

Again, the devil is in the detail. In the years leading up to 2008, Ireland’s rural locations did add far too many homes than would be needed in the long-term, under any realistic measure.1 Between 2000 and 2008, for example, the north-west rural County Leitrim, a three-hour drive from Dublin and a two-hour drive from Galway city, added nearly 7,700 new dwellings. This was a remarkable feat given that in the previous Census of 1996, Leitrim had fewer than 8,400 households.

细节决定成败。在 2008 年之前的几年里，爱尔兰农村地区增加的住宅数量确实远远超出了长期需求，无论从哪个角度来看都是如此。1 例如，从 2000 年到 2008 年，距离都柏林三小时车程、距离戈尔韦市两小时车程的西北部农村地区莱特里姆郡（County Leitrim）新增了近 7700 套住房。这是一项了不起的成就，因为在 1996 年的上一次人口普查中，莱特里姆郡只有不到 8,400 户家庭。
