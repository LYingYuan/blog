The reason the Internet was so awesome in the 90s and even early 00s was because everything on it was put there by people who cared enough about the content to want to put it up. There was very little monetization, esp in the 90s. Also inter-connection was prioritized — we were all waypoints, little islands, on someones journey. We didnt try to maximize the users time staying on our site.

互联网在 90 年代甚至 00 年代初之所以如此之好，是因为互联网上的一切都是由那些足够关心内容的人放上去的。尤其是在上世纪 90 年代，几乎没有货币化。同时，互联也是优先考虑的--我们都是别人旅途中的航点、小岛。我们并没有试图最大限度地延长用户在网站上的停留时间。

If you want to make the Internet a tiny bit better, create your own content, on your own domain, and dont monetize it. Just write, create, share. Dont worry about traffic, or anything like that. Be a small voice in a big void that is true to itself. Use no advertisements. Generously link to sites that you feel are relevant to the content, particularly if its contextual, in the document.

如果你想让互联网变得更好一点，那就在自己的域名上创建自己的内容，不要将其货币化。只管写作、创作、分享。不用担心流量或其他类似问题。在茫茫人海中发出自己真实的声音。不做广告。在文件中慷慨地链接到你认为与内容相关的网站，尤其是与上下文相关的网站。
