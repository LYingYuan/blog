While voters typically are mostly moved by their views of the economy, this election year is being shaped, in part, by two conflicts abroad — the Middle East and Ukraine.

虽然选民通常主要受经济观点的影响，但今年的选举在一定程度上是由中东和乌克兰这两场海外冲突决定的。

Donald Trump, Biden’s likely opponent in November, long has touted his staunch support for Israel. That’s been crucial for support from conservatives, evangelicals and several big donors. He also says he’s in favor of banning refugees from Gaza from entering the US.

唐纳德 - 特朗普（Donald Trump）很可能是拜登在 11 月份的对手，他长期以来一直鼓吹自己对以色列的坚定支持。这对获得保守派、福音派和一些大捐赠者的支持至关重要。他还表示赞成禁止加沙难民进入美国。

But he also has the advantage of not being in office and having to commit to a policy. And any spread of the conflict in the region is a wild card.

但他也有一个优势，那就是不在任上，不必对政策做出承诺。而且，该地区冲突的任何蔓延都是一个未知数。

The conflict within Trump’s coalition is Ukraine. While the former president and supporters of his America First ideology have pushed back against further aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s invasion, more traditional Republicans back robust assistance.

特朗普联盟内部的冲突在于乌克兰。尽管这位前总统及其 "美国优先 "意识形态的支持者反对进一步援助乌克兰抗击俄罗斯的入侵，但更多的传统共和党人支持大力援助。

Fed pause: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled this week that the US central bank would likely not be ready to lower interest rates by its next meeting in March. That position likely was bolstered today by a labor market report for January that blew past forecasts. The economy gained 353,000 jobs and the Labor Department also revised December’s number higher. Still, initial and recurring applications for unemployment benefits both rose to a two-month high, suggesting some cooling of the jobs market.

美联储暂停：美联储主席杰罗姆 - 鲍威尔（Jerome Powell）本周表示，美国央行很可能不会在 3 月份的下次会议上降低利率。今天公布的 1 月份劳动力市场报告超过了预期，可能会对这一立场起到支撑作用。美国经济增加了 35.3 万个就业岗位，劳工部还将 12 月份的就业人数上调。不过，初次和再次申请失业救济的人数均升至两个月来的新高，表明就业市场有所降温。

Primary day: South Carolina will hold its Democratic primary on Saturday, where Biden is expected to cruise to victory. Black voters account for more than half of voting Democrats, according to 2020 polling, meaning the contest will serve as a litmus test for his support with a crucial constituency. The campaign has invested time and effort in signaling to the bloc nationally that it’s prioritizing their concerns.

初选日：南卡罗来纳州将于周六举行民主党初选，预计拜登将在初选中获胜。根据 2020 年的民意调查，黑人选民占民主党投票人数的一半以上，这意味着这场竞选将成为检验拜登在这一关键选区支持率的试金石。竞选团队已投入大量时间和精力，在全国范围内向这一群体发出信号，表明他们的关切将被优先考虑。

Border talks: Long-awaited legislation on a deal to tie fresh Ukraine funding to immigration reform is finally expected to be put to a Senate vote next week after months of bipartisan negotiations. The bill faces tough odds in the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson has already declared it "dead on arrival."

However, House lawmakers have yet to see the text of the bill, which is expected to be released this weekend.
边境谈判：经过两党数月的谈判，参议院终于有望在下周对一项期待已久的立法进行表决，该立法旨在将新的乌克兰拨款与移民改革挂钩。该法案在众议院面临严峻挑战，众议院议长迈克 - 约翰逊（Mike Johnson）已宣布该法案 "胎死腹中"。不过，众议院议员尚未看到法案文本，预计将于本周末公布。

The US Air Force is planning a major structural shakeup that would consolidate some commands and streamline the organization to meet China’s military buildup, Politico reports.

据 Politico 报道，美国空军正计划进行一次重大结构调整，合并一些司令部并精简机构，以应对中国的军事集结。
