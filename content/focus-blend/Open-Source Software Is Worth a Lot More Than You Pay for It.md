A new estimate from researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto finds that the worldwide value of all open-source software is about $8.8 trillion. To place that in perspective, about $3.4 trillion was spent on commercial software globally in 2020. The $8.8 trillion figure is more than double the current gross domestic product of India at current market exchange rates. It’s almost triple the latest market capitalizations of Apple and Microsoft. All the gold in the world is currently worth more than $13 trillion, give or take.

哈佛大学和多伦多大学的研究人员最新估计，全球所有开源软件的价值约为 8.8 万亿美元。从这个角度来看，2020 年全球在商业软件上的花费约为 3.4 万亿美元。按当前市场汇率计算，8.8 万亿美元是印度国内生产总值的两倍多。这几乎是苹果和微软最新市值的三倍。世界上所有的黄金目前价值超过 13 万亿美元。

Yet even this $8.8 trillion estimate understates the benefits of open-source software. By putting open-source in the market, it ensures that commercial producers have to “compete against free.” That leads them to lower their prices, which in turn allows more people to buy the closed-source products. Open-source also forestalls the possibility of complete monopoly in the market, since there will now be an open-source alternative. And, from a production standpoint, open-source software also lowers costs, since commercial producers can learn from and even copy its programming ideas.

然而，即使是这 8.8 万亿美元的估算也低估了开源软件的好处。将开源软件推向市场，可以确保商业生产商不得不 "与免费软件竞争"。这导致他们降低价格，反过来又让更多的人购买封闭源代码产品。开源还能防止市场出现完全垄断的可能性，因为现在有了开源的替代品。而且，从生产的角度来看，开源软件还可以降低成本，因为商业生产商可以借鉴甚至复制开源软件的编程思想。
