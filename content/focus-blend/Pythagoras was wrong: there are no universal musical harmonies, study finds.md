According to the Ancient Greek philosopher Pythagoras, ‘consonance’ – a pleasant-sounding combination of notes – is produced by special relationships between simple numbers such as 3 and 4. More recently, scholars have tried to find psychological explanations, but these ‘integer ratios’ are still credited with making a chord sound beautiful, and deviation from them is thought to make music ‘dissonant’, unpleasant sounding.

古希腊哲学家毕达哥拉斯认为，"协和"--一种悦耳动听的音符组合--是由 3 和 4 等简单数字之间的特殊关系产生的。最近，学者们试图找到心理学的解释，但这些 "整数比 "仍被认为能使和弦发出美妙的声音，而偏离它们则被认为会使音乐 "不和谐"，听起来不舒服。

Their study, published in Nature Communications, shows that in normal listening contexts, we do not actually prefer chords to be perfectly in these mathematical ratios.

他们发表在《自然 - 通讯》（Nature Communications）上的研究表明，在正常的听力环境中，我们实际上并不喜欢和弦完全符合这些数学比例。

“We prefer slight amounts of deviation. We like a little imperfection because this gives life to the sounds, and that is attractive to us,” said co-author, Dr Peter Harrison, from Cambridge’s Faculty of Music and Director of its Centre for Music and Science.

"我们喜欢轻微的偏差。合著者、剑桥大学音乐学院音乐与科学中心主任彼得 - 哈里森（Peter Harrison）博士说："我们喜欢轻微的不完美，因为这赋予了声音生命，对我们很有吸引力。

“Music creation is all about exploring the creative possibilities of a given set of qualities, for example, finding out what kinds of melodies can you play on a flute, or what kinds of sounds can you make with your mouth,” Harrison said.

"哈里森说："音乐创作就是要探索特定品质的创造可能性，例如，你可以用长笛吹出什么样的旋律，或者你可以用嘴发出什么样的声音。

“Our findings suggest that if you use different instruments, you can unlock a whole new harmonic language that people intuitively appreciate, they don’t need to study it to appreciate it. A lot of experimental music in the last 100 years of Western classical music has been quite hard for listeners because it involves highly abstract structures that are hard to enjoy. In contrast, psychological findings like ours can help stimulate new music that listeners intuitively enjoy.”

"我们的研究结果表明，如果你使用不同的乐器，你就能开启一种全新的和声语言，人们凭直觉就能欣赏这种语言，而不需要通过学习才能欣赏。在过去的 100 年里，西方古典音乐中的很多实验性音乐对听众来说都是相当困难的，因为这些音乐涉及高度抽象的结构，很难让人喜欢。相比之下，像我们这样的心理学研究成果则有助于激发听众凭直觉就能欣赏的新音乐"。

Dr Harrison hopes that the research will encourage musicians to try out unfamiliar instruments and see if they offer new harmonies and open up new creative possibilities.

哈里森博士希望这项研究能鼓励音乐家们尝试使用陌生的乐器，看看它们是否能带来新的和声，开辟新的创作可能性。
