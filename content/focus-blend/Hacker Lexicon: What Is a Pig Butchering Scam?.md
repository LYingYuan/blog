“That’s the whole pig butchering thing—they are going for the whole hog,” says Sean Gallagher, a senior threat researcher at the security firm Sophos who has been tracking pig butchering as it has emerged over the past three years. “They go after people who are vulnerable. Some of the victims are people who have had long-term health problems, who are older, people who feel isolated. They want to get every last bit of oink, and they are persistent.”

安全公司 Sophos 的高级威胁研究员肖恩 - 加拉格尔（Sean Gallagher）说："这就是杀猪的整个过程--他们要杀的是整头猪。"他在过去三年里一直在追踪杀猪事件的出现。他说："他们的目标是那些易受攻击的人。一些受害者是有长期健康问题的人、老年人、感到孤独的人。他们想要得到每一口猪肉，而且锲而不舍。"


Though carrying off pig butchering scams takes a lot of communication and relationship building with victims over time, researchers say that crime syndicates in China developed scripts and playbooks that allowed them to offload the work at scale onto inexperienced scammers or even forced laborers who are victims of human trafficking. 

研究人员说，虽然实施杀猪骗局需要与受害者进行大量的沟通并建立长期的关系，但中国的犯罪集团开发出了脚本和剧本，使他们能够将工作大规模地交给没有经验的骗子，甚至是人口贩运受害者中的强迫劳工。
