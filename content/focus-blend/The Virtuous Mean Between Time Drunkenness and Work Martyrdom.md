Geuss examines the modernist notion of work, positing that there are six criteria for defining it, with the first three constituting its essence:

Geuss 探讨了现代主义的工作概念，认为有六条标准可以定义工作，其中前三条构成了工作的本质：

1. Exertion. It involves strenuous effort.
2. Necessity. It is a necessity of life, needed for survival.
3. Objectivity. It results in outcomes that can be independently measured and assessed, aka goods and services.
4. Distinction. It is a distinct activity best done in a space designed for working, aka a factory, office, co-working space, etc.
5. Seriousness. It is not meant to be fun or something done for pleasure.
6. Money. It is an activity one does to receive money.

On one end of the foolish spectrum, we have “time drunks,” a term from Underearners Anonymous, a twelve-step program modeled on Alcoholics Anonymous to help individuals overcome “underearning.” They frame being an underearner as a mental disorder associated with horrible time management and a poor pursuit of personal potential, particularly in how it manifests within the market economy.

在愚昧的一端，我们有 "时间酒鬼"，这个词来自 "学习不足者匿名协会"（Underearners Anonymous），这是一个以匿名嗜酒者协会为蓝本的十二步计划，旨在帮助个人克服 "学习不足"。他们将 "学习不足者 "定义为一种精神障碍，与糟糕的时间管理和对个人潜能的拙劣追求有关，尤其是在市场经济中的表现形式。

On the other end of the spectrum, we have “work martyrs,” a phrase coined by a defunct research project advocating for the importance of non-work time as essential for well-being. A work martyr experiences guilt when on vacation, compromising their health and relationships by pathologically going “above and beyond” and priding themselves on their superior work ethic. In truth, they suffer from low self-esteem and place the needs of their parents, teachers, or employers above their own, hungry for validation.

在光谱的另一端，我们有 "工作殉道者"，这个词是由一个已不存在的研究项目创造的，该项目倡导非工作时间对幸福至关重要。工作殉道者在休假时会有负罪感，他们会病态地 "超越自我"，以自己高超的职业道德为荣，从而损害自己的健康和人际关系。事实上，他们自卑，将父母、老师或雇主的需求置于自己的需求之上，渴望得到肯定。

What does the virtuous mean between time drunkenness and work martyrdom look like? We can find the answer to this by honoring the lesson each fool provides us. For the time drunk, the lesson is found in the word “drunk.” To be time drunk means to be so “drunk” that one forgets time exists. This forgetfulness is presented as a bad thing, given its inefficiency in the market economy. However, forgetting time is the right move when it comes to sacred considerations.

介于时间醉酒和工作殉道之间的良性意义是什么样子的呢？我们可以通过尊重每个傻瓜为我们提供的教训来找到答案。对于 "时醉 "来说，教训就在 "醉 "这个字上。时间之醉意味着 "醉 "得忘记了时间的存在。由于在市场经济中效率低下，这种遗忘被视为一件坏事。然而，就神圣的意义而言，忘记时间才是正确之举。

In philosopher Josef Pieper’s Leisure: The Basis of Culture, true leisure is a kind of spiritual silence, fostering a timeless state and opening one toward the whole. Leisure is not the cessation of work but a contemplative disposition that puts work in its proper place. This leisure ontology has gradually dissipated from everyday life, with a working ontology capturing more of our “time,” instrumentalizing everything toward work. Time drunks deeply intuit this, and their procrastination-induced state of timelessness should not be considered a terrible character flaw but rather an act of spiritual rebellion against modernity.

在哲学家约瑟夫 - 皮佩尔的《闲暇：文化的基础》一书中，真正的闲暇是一种精神上的静默，它培养一种永恒的状态，使人向整体敞开。休闲不是停止工作，而是一种沉思的态度，将工作置于适当的位置。这种休闲本体论已逐渐从日常生活中消失，工作本体论占据了我们更多的 "时间"，将一切工具化，以工作为导向。时间醉汉们深深地体会到了这一点，他们因拖延而导致的永恒状态不应被视为可怕的性格缺陷，而应被视为对现代性的精神反叛行为。

The work martyr acts foolishly by sacrificing the wrong thing for the wrong reason toward the wrong person. However, the selfless spirit of their sacrifice is correct. While the drunks get the timeless piece right, the martyrs get the selfless piece right. One should not be working for their egos, greedily hoarding material luxuries, but they should work for those they live for and toward the wise lifestyle they are called to live.

劳动烈士的行为是愚蠢的，他们为了错误的原因，对错误的人做出了错误的牺牲。然而，他们无私奉献的精神是正确的。酒鬼们说对了永恒的部分，而烈士们说对了无私的部分。一个人不应该为自我而工作，贪婪地追求物质上的奢华，而应该为他们所生活的人而工作，为他们所追求的明智的生活方式而工作。


**Work should neither be demonized nor overly glorified but wisely seen as a necessary aspect of life that offers an opportunity for timelessness, allowing us to serve those who matter most.**

**工作既不应被妖魔化，也不应被过度美化，而应被明智地视为生活的一个必要方面，它提供了一个永恒的机会，让我们能够为那些最重要的人服务。**
