Geuss examines the modernist notion of work, positing that there are six criteria for defining it, with the first three constituting its essence:

Geuss 探讨了现代主义的工作概念，认为有六条标准可以定义工作，其中前三条构成了工作的本质：

1. Exertion. It involves strenuous effort.
2. Necessity. It is a necessity of life, needed for survival.
3. Objectivity. It results in outcomes that can be independently measured and assessed, aka goods and services.
4. Distinction. It is a distinct activity best done in a space designed for working, aka a factory, office, co-working space, etc.
5. Seriousness. It is not meant to be fun or something done for pleasure.
6. Money. It is an activity one does to receive money.

On one end of the foolish spectrum, we have “time drunks,” a term from Underearners Anonymous, a twelve-step program modeled on Alcoholics Anonymous to help individuals overcome “underearning.” They frame being an underearner as a mental disorder associated with horrible time management and a poor pursuit of personal potential, particularly in how it manifests within the market economy.

在愚昧的一端，我们有 "时间酒鬼"，这个词来自 "学习不足者匿名协会"（Underearners Anonymous），这是一个以匿名嗜酒者协会为蓝本的十二步计划，旨在帮助个人克服 "学习不足"。他们将 "学习不足者 "定义为一种精神障碍，与糟糕的时间管理和对个人潜能的拙劣追求有关，尤其是在市场经济中的表现形式。

On the other end of the spectrum, we have “work martyrs,” a phrase coined by a defunct research project advocating for the importance of non-work time as essential for well-being. A work martyr experiences guilt when on vacation, compromising their health and relationships by pathologically going “above and beyond” and priding themselves on their superior work ethic. In truth, they suffer from low self-esteem and place the needs of their parents, teachers, or employers above their own, hungry for validation.

在光谱的另一端，我们有 "工作殉道者"，这个词是由一个已不存在的研究项目创造的，该项目倡导非工作时间对幸福至关重要。工作殉道者在休假时会有负罪感，他们会病态地 "超越自我"，以自己高超的职业道德为荣，从而损害自己的健康和人际关系。事实上，他们自卑，将父母、老师或雇主的需求置于自己的需求之上，渴望得到肯定。
