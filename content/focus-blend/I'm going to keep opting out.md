I'll screen out emails, I'll block them, I'll unsubscribe, I'll report them as spam. I'll reply with STOP to unsubscribe (again and again and again). I'll refuse direct mailers, I'll block ads, I'll block the banners that spring up in their place.

因此，虽然这很麻烦，但我会继续选择退出。我会过滤掉邮件，屏蔽它们，取消订阅，报告它们是垃圾邮件。我会回复 STOP 取消订阅（一次又一次）。我会拒绝直邮，我会屏蔽广告，我会屏蔽在它们的位置上出现的横幅。

If I need something I'll buy it — I'll seek it out but if you insist upon my attention, if you make a pitch or a hard sale I'm going to walk away. It's reflexive.

如果我需要什么，我会去买--我会去寻找，但如果你坚持要我注意，如果你做推销或硬性销售，我就会走开。这是条件反射。

I devote time to things I care deeply about. I'll chase them, I'll seek them out and I'll invest in them. Everyone does that to some degree or another. There is so much insistence and intrusion that opting out becomes both laborious and necessary.

我把时间花在我深深关心的事情上。我会追逐它们，寻找它们，投资它们。每个人或多或少都会这样做。有太多的坚持和侵扰，选择退出变得既费力又必要。
