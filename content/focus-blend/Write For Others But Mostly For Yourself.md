Looking back at my 6 years of blogging now it’s hard to recognise myself from the engineer I was back then before writing was a regular habit for me. It’s funny because in the end my blog was the key to unlock the next door in my career but not necessarily for the reasons I expected. I figured if I could write some interesting posts I could turn up to an interview and use it as a kind of portfolio, but it became so much more than that.

现在回首我 6 年的博客生涯，很难再认出那时的我了，那时我还是一名工程师，写作还没有成为我的固定习惯。有趣的是，我的博客最终成了打开我职业生涯下一扇门的钥匙，但原因未必如我所料。我想，如果我能写出一些有趣的文章，我就可以去面试，并把它作为一种作品集，但它变得远远不止这些。

Writing wasn’t just about me explaining something to an audience, it was a tool to give rigor to my thinking.

写作并不仅仅是我向读者解释什么，它还是让我的思维更加严谨的工具。

My recommendation is that you don’t look at blog writing as just something people do to work on their “personal brand”. It can definitely help with that, but first and foremost it is a tool that people can use to up their game and take their knowledge and critical thinking to the next level.

我的建议是，不要把写博客仅仅看作是人们为了打造 "个人品牌 "而做的事情。写博客肯定会对 "个人品牌 "有所帮助，但它首先是一种工具，人们可以用它来提高自己的水平，将自己的知识和批判性思维提升到一个新的层次。

It is like training for your thinking, it makes you more powerful which translates to better understanding and greater insight. Blogging is less popular now than it was but don’t let that stop you, in the end the person that benefits most, even if few people read it, is you.

这就像训练你的思维一样，它让你变得更强大，从而转化为更好的理解力和更高的洞察力。博客现在没有以前那么流行了，但不要因此而放弃，归根结底，受益最大的人是你自己，即使很少有人读它。
