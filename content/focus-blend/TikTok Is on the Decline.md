TikTok is not anywhere near dead or dying; it’s more that you can sense a less-than-ideal vibe shift on the platform. With its revenue increasingly driven by consumer spending, you can expect TikTok to push even harder into Shop-like ventures, through exclusive subscription spaces or paid-for benefits like the ability to upload longer videos, even as it continues to slash its already-measly payouts to videomakers and musicians. Because, even though the app still takes in heaping amounts of ad revenue, its new request for agencies to increase their app spending isn’t going over great with advertising executives. That may be thanks, in part, to the geopolitical firestorms occurring even outside home nation China: The app’s image-making prowess is universally credited with assisting the recent electoral successes of strongmen in the Philippines, Argentina, and Indonesia. It’s a rickety situation in the United States as well: Politicians like Sen. John Fetterman, who once actively courted the app’s many youth organizers, are now parroting unfounded talking points about how TikTok is turning those very activists into Hamas surrogates. (Fetterman has not posted any new videos to his profile since making those comments in December.)

TikTok 并没有濒临死亡或濒临消亡，只是你能感觉到这个平台的氛围正在发生变化。随着 TikTok 的收入越来越多地由消费者支出驱动，你可以预见 TikTok 将通过独家订阅空间或上传更长视频等付费功能，更加努力地推进类似商店的业务，即使它继续削减对视频制作人和音乐人已经微薄的报酬。因为，尽管该应用仍然获得了大量的广告收入，但它要求广告公司增加应用支出的新要求并没有得到广告主管们的认同。这在一定程度上可能要归功于中国以外的地缘政治风暴：菲律宾、阿根廷和印尼的强人在最近的选举中取得了成功，人们普遍认为是这款应用的形象塑造能力在起作用。美国的情况也是如此：约翰 - 费特曼（John Fetterman）参议员等政客曾积极争取该应用的众多青年组织者，如今却在毫无根据地谈论 TikTok 如何将这些积极分子变成哈马斯的代理人。(自 12 月发表上述言论以来，费特曼就没有在他的个人主页上发布过任何新视频）。
