Collective harmony and hierarchy are strongly idealised across East Asia. Communication is thus implicit and indirect. Conflict aversion and emotional suppression make it harder to learn what someone else really thinks. So what’s the solution?

在整个东亚地区，集体和谐和等级制度是非常理想化的。因此，交流是隐性和间接的。冲突规避和情感压抑使得了解别人的真实想法变得更加困难。那么解决方案是什么呢？

Alcohol reduces people’s inhibitions. This promotes social bonding and information-sharing. As argued in Edward Slingerland’s book “Drunk”, it benefits businesses! But this exact same cognitive shift also elevates risks of sexual abuse. Women may prefer to leave early. By doing so, they miss out on homosocial boozing and schmoozing.

酒精会降低人们的抑制力。这促进了社会联系和信息共享。正如爱德华 - 斯林格兰（Edward Slingerland）在《醉酒》一书中所论述的，这对企业有利！但同样的认知转变也会增加性虐待的风险。女性可能更愿意早早离开。这样一来，她们就错过了同性社交的觥筹交错。

Cultures vary in how much they value direct or indirect communication. In “The Culture Map”, Erin Meyer helpfully details the global heterogeneity of communication styles. Americans are extremely direct, they say what they think. Brits are a bit more subtle. To be polite we sugar-coat criticism, in ways that can be confusing for outsiders. Japanese are even more indirect: one must read between the lines.

不同文化对直接或间接沟通的重视程度各不相同。在《文化地图》一书中，艾琳 - 迈耶详细介绍了全球沟通方式的异质性。美国人非常直接，他们有话直说。英国人则比较含蓄。为了礼貌起见，我们会给批评涂上糖衣，这可能会让外人感到困惑。日本人则更加间接：我们必须从字里行间去解读。

The Dutch and Israelis are famously direct. They don’t mind confrontation, so usually speak their mind and take no offence. By contrast, East Asians are more likely to value collective harmony. This means that they avoid direct confrontation, so artfully use be more subtle and diplomatic language.

荷兰人和以色列人的直接是出了名的。他们不介意对抗，因此通常直抒胸臆，不会冒犯他人。相比之下，东亚人更重视集体和谐。这意味着他们避免直接对抗，因此会巧妙地使用更加含蓄的外交语言。

East Asian societies are also more hierarchical. Korean school children typically bow to their teachers, and use more respectful language when communicating with elders. Korean adults also abide by age-based seniority.

东亚社会的等级制度也更为森严。韩国学生通常会向老师鞠躬，与长辈交流时也会使用更加尊敬的语言。韩国成年人也遵守按年龄论资排辈的原则。

In societies that idealise hierarchy, speaking one’s mind is downright impertinent. Whereas the Swedes talk far more frankly, since they regard themselves as a society of equals.

在理想化等级制度的社会里，说出自己的想法简直就是无礼。而瑞典人则坦率得多，因为他们认为自己是一个平等的社会。

Even if direct confrontation is viewed negatively, people still want to communicate! Koreans often described an enormous disjunction between their conversations with friends (normal and polite) and online comment boards (extremely aggressive). When posting anonymously, Koreans speak their mind.

即使人们对直接对抗持否定态度，他们仍然希望进行交流！韩国人经常描述他们与朋友的谈话（正常而礼貌）和网上评论栏（极具攻击性）之间的巨大差异。在匿名发帖时，韩国人畅所欲言。

If schools and firms explicitly encouraged more direct communication (as does happen in many international East Asian firms), maybe alcohol would be made redundant?

如果学校和公司明确鼓励更直接的交流（就像许多东亚国际公司所做的那样），也许酒精就会变得多余？
