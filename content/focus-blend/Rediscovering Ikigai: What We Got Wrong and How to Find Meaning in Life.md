What makes it such a powerful idea in today’s age of constant change and uncertainty is that ikigai doesn’t limit someone’s value in life to career and financial status. In fact, in a survey of 2,000 Japanese people conducted by Central Research Services, only a third of respondents considered work as their ikigai.

在当今这个不断变化和充满不确定性的时代，"我的人生 "之所以是一个如此强大的理念，是因为它并不把一个人的人生价值局限于职业和经济地位。事实上，在 Central Research Services 对 2000 名日本人进行的一项调查中，只有三分之一的受访者认为工作是他们的 "人生目标"。

However, the concept of ikigai is not about finding the intersection of what you love, what you’re good at, what the world needs, and what you can get paid for. It’s just about finding pleasure in life and being happy to get up in the morning.

然而，"ikigai "的概念并不是要找到你所热爱的、你所擅长的、世界所需要的和你能得到报酬的交汇点。它只是要在生活中找到乐趣，让自己每天早上都能快乐地起床。

“Japanese people don’t view ikigai as a lofty goal, a destination, or something to achieve,” explains Nicholas Kemp, author of the book Ikigai-Kan. Similarly, in The Little Book of Ikigai, Ken Mogi wrote: “Japanese do not need grandiose motivational frameworks to keep going, but rely more on the little rituals in their daily routines.”

"Ikigai-Kan》一书的作者尼古拉斯 - 坎普（Nicholas Kemp）解释说："日本人并不认为'Ikigai'是一个崇高的目标、一个终点，或者是要实现的东西。同样，Ken Mogi 在《The Little Book of Ikigai》一书中写道："日本人不需要宏大的激励框架来坚持下去，他们更依赖于日常生活中的小仪式"。

1. Stop seeking your One True Passion. Many of us think that finding our passion will magically give our life a purpose. Instead, find meaning in your daily experiences and interactions. Explore the world around and inside you. Learn something new everyday, including about yourself. Play with uncertainty instead of chasing the next milestone.
2. Embrace lifelong learning. The concept of ikigai never mentions being good at what you do. There is joy in being a beginner all over again, learning through mistakes, and growing outside of your comfort zone. Don’t try to be the expert in the room. Keep asking questions. Never stop learning.
3. Let go of lofty financial goals. Ikigai also doesn’t have anything to do with money. Of course, we all need enough money to live a comfortable life, and money can help explore projects and ideas that bring you pleasure in life, but beyond the point of comfort, financial success should be seen as a potential byproduct of living a meaningful life.
4. Don’t try to save the world. Instead, focus on the positive impact you can have on your friends, family, colleagues, and community. Ask yourself how you can connect with people in meaningful ways and which changes you want to bring to life. This is how we save the world — when everyone contributes at their own human scale.

5. 停止寻找你的唯一真爱。我们中的许多人都认为，找到自己的激情就能神奇地赋予我们的生活以意义。相反，我们应该在日常经历和互动中寻找意义。探索你周围和内心的世界。每天学习新知识，包括关于你自己的知识。与不确定性玩耍，而不是追逐下一个里程碑。
6. 终身学习。ikigai（终身学习）的概念从来没有提到要精通自己所做的事情。从头再来，从错误中学习，在舒适区之外成长，这就是初学者的乐趣所在。不要试图成为房间里的专家。不断提问。永远不要停止学习。
7. 放弃崇高的财务目标。Ikigai 也与金钱无关。当然，我们都需要足够的钱来过上舒适的生活，钱可以帮助我们探索能给生活带来乐趣的项目和想法，但在舒适的生活之外，经济上的成功应被视为有意义生活的潜在副产品。
8. 不要试图拯救世界。相反，请关注你能为朋友、家人、同事和社区带来的积极影响。问问自己，如何才能以有意义的方式与人们建立联系，以及你希望带来哪些改变。这就是我们拯救世界的方式--当每个人都在自己的人类尺度上做出贡献时。

Instead of pursuing a grand life purpose, optimize for wanting to wake up in the morning. Live a life of curiosity and connection. Trust that success will be a byproduct of the meaning you find in daily experiences.

与其追求宏大的人生目标，不如优化自己的生活，让自己每天早上都能醒来。过一种充满好奇和联系的生活。相信成功将是你在日常经历中发现意义的副产品。
