Many creative people think these are the only options—both for them and their audience. Either they give the audience what it wants (the entertainer’s job) or else they put demands on the public (that’s where art begins).

许多有创造力的人认为这是唯一的选择--对他们自己和观众都是如此。他们要么给观众想要的东西（艺人的工作），要么向公众提出要求（这才是艺术的起点）。

We’re witnessing the birth of a post-entertainment culture. And it won’t help the arts. In fact, it won’t help society at all.

我们正在见证一种后娱乐文化的诞生。这对艺术毫无帮助。事实上，它对社会毫无帮助。

The TV business also hit a wall in 2023. After years of steady growth, the number of scripted series has started shrinking.

电视业务也在 2023 年碰壁。经过多年的稳定增长后，剧本剧集的数量开始萎缩。

In 2024, musicians are actually worth more old than young, dead than alive.

2024 年，音乐家的价值实际上是老的比年轻的更值钱，死的比活的更值钱。

The fastest growing sector of the culture economy is distraction. Or call it scrolling or swiping or wasting time or whatever you want. But it’s not art or entertainment, just ceaseless activity.

文化经济中增长最快的领域是分心。或称之为滚动、刷屏、浪费时间或其他任何你想说的东西。但这不是艺术或娱乐，只是无休止的活动。

This is more than just the hot trend of 2024. It can last forever—because it’s based on body chemistry, not fashion or aesthetics.

这不仅仅是 2024 年的热门趋势。它可以永远持续下去--因为它基于人体化学，而不是时尚或审美。

Only now it is getting applied to culture and the creative world—and billions of people. They are unwitting volunteers in the largest social engineering experiment in human history.

只是现在，它被应用于文化和创意世界--以及数十亿人。他们是人类历史上最大的社会工程实验中不知情的志愿者。

So you need to ditch that simple model of art versus entertainment. And even ‘distraction’ is just a stepping stone toward the real goal nowadays—which is addiction.

因此，你需要抛弃艺术与娱乐的简单模式。如今，即使是 "分散注意力 "也不过是通往真正目标的垫脚石--那就是沉迷。

Here’s the future cultural food chain—pursued aggressively by tech platforms that now dominate every aspect of our lives.

这就是未来的文化食物链--由现在主导我们生活方方面面的科技平台积极推动的文化食物链。

The tech platforms aren’t like the Medici in Florence, or those other rich patrons of the arts. They don’t want to find the next Michelangelo or Mozart. They want to create a world of junkies—because they will be the dealers.

科技平台不像佛罗伦萨的美第奇家族，也不像其他那些富有的艺术赞助人。他们不想寻找下一个米开朗基罗或莫扎特。他们想创造一个瘾君子的世界--因为他们将成为经销商。

But still they push aggressively forward—they don’t want to lose market share to the other dopamine cartel members. And with a special focus on children. They figured out what every junk peddler already knows: It’s more profitable to get users locked in while they’re young.

但他们仍在积极推进--他们不想把市场份额拱手让给多巴胺卡特尔的其他成员。他们还特别关注儿童。他们想明白了每个垃圾贩子都知道的道理：趁用户年轻时将其锁定，会更有利可图。

Here’s where the science gets really ugly. The more addicts rely on these stimuli, the less pleasure they receive. At a certain point, this cycle creates anhedonia—the complete absence of enjoyment in an experience supposedly pursued for pleasure.

这就是科学变得丑陋的地方。成瘾者越依赖这些刺激，获得的快感就越少。到了一定程度，这种循环就会造成失乐症--在本应追求快乐的体验中完全失去乐趣。

How can pursuing pleasure lead to less pleasure? But that’s how our brains are wired (perhaps as a protective mechanism). At a certain point, addicts still pursue the stimulus, but more to avoid the pain of dopamine deprivation.

追求快乐怎么会导致快乐减少呢？但这就是我们大脑的构造（也许是一种保护机制）。到了一定程度，成瘾者仍然会追求刺激，但更多的是为了避免多巴胺剥夺带来的痛苦。

People addicted to painkillers have the same experience. Beyond a certain level, opioid dependence actually makes the pain worse.

对止痛药上瘾的人也有同样的经历。超过一定程度，对阿片类药物的依赖实际上会使疼痛加剧。

Some companies get people hooked with pills and needles. Others with apps and algorithms. But either ways, it’s just churning out junkies.

有些公司用药丸和针头让人们上瘾。有些公司则通过应用程序和算法让人们上瘾。但无论哪种方式，都只是在制造瘾君子。

That’s our dystopian future. Not so much Orwell’s 1984—more like Huxley’s Brave New World.

这就是我们乌托邦式的未来。与其说是奥威尔的《1984》，不如说是赫胥黎的《美丽新世界》。

Also, do yourself a favor. Unplug yourself from time to time, and start noticing the trees or your goofy pets. They actually look better in real life than in the headset.

另外，帮你自己一个忙。时不时拔掉耳机，开始留意树木或你的呆萌宠物。事实上，它们在现实生活中比在耳机中看起来更美。

From the comments:

At lot of people now no longer think an experience is real or valid in itself unless they can record it on their mobile phone and probably upload it to social media for social validation and attention. This is crazy. The real world isn't real enough anymore, it has to exist online instead with likes attached.

现在，很多人不再认为经历本身是真实或有效的，除非他们能用手机记录下来，并上传到社交媒体，以获得社会的认可和关注。这太疯狂了。现实世界已经不够真实了，它必须在网络上存在，并附带点赞。
