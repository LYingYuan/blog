6. Lower letter spacing and line height with larger text. Raise them with smaller text
7. Container borders should contrast with both the container and the background
8. Everything should be aligned with something else
9. Colours in a palette should have distinct brightness values
10. If you saturate your neutrals you should use warm or cool colours, not both
11. Measurements should be mathematically related
12. Elements should go in order of visual weight
13. If you use a horizontal grid, use 12 columns
14. Spacing should go between points of high contrast
15. Closer elements should be lighter
16. Make drop shadow blur values double their distance values
17. Put simple on complex or complex on simple
