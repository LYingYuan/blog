My research, published in my new book about leadership in professional organizations, shows that our tendency to overwork and burn out is framed by a complex combination of factors involving our profession, our organization, and ourselves. At the heart of it is insecurity. As one senior business unit leader in a law firm admitted to me: “I just come in here and work as hard as I can all the time. I feel like I’m doing a good job, but it’s hard to measure. That’s the nature of what we do: It’s feast or famine. And we all tend to be such insecure people that we’re all scared all the time.”

我在关于专业组织领导力的新书中发表的研究表明，我们的工作过度和倦怠倾向是由涉及我们的专业、我们的组织和我们自身的一系列复杂因素共同造成的。其核心是缺乏安全感。正如一位律师事务所业务部门的高级领导向我承认的那样："我来到这里，就一直拼命工作。我觉得自己做得很好，但很难衡量。这就是我们工作的性质：不成功便成仁我们都是缺乏安全感的人 所以我们一直都很害怕"

The 500 interviews I conducted for my book showed a pattern: A professional’s insecurity is rooted in the inherent intangibility of knowledge work. How do you convince your client that you know something worthwhile and justify the high fees you charge? The insecurity caused by this intangibility is exacerbated by the rigorous “up or out” promotion system perpetuated by elite professional organizations, which turns your colleagues into your competitors. How do you convince your boss that you’re worth more than your closest colleague? There is no chance for a professional to rest on their laurels — or even to rest.

我为撰写本书而进行的 500 次访谈显示了一种模式：专业人士的不安全感源于知识工作固有的不确定性。如何让客户相信你所知道的东西是有价值的，并证明你所收取的高额费用是合理的？这种无形性造成的不安全感又因精英专业组织长期实行的严格的 "非升即走 "晋升制度而加剧，这种制度把你的同事变成了你的竞争对手。如何让老板相信你比最亲密的同事更有价值？专业人士没有机会安于现状，甚至没有机会休息。

Exacerbating this problem, elite professional organizations deliberately set out to identify and recruit “insecure overachievers” — some leading professional organizations explicitly use this terminology, though not in public. Insecure overachievers are exceptionally capable and fiercely ambitious, yet driven by a profound sense of their own inadequacy. This typically stems from childhood, and may result from various factors, such as experience of financial or physical deprivation, or a belief that their parents’ love was contingent upon their behaving and performing well.

使这一问题更加严重的是，精英专业组织有意识地发掘和招募 "缺乏安全感的超额完成任务者"--一些领先的专业组织明确使用这一术语，尽管不是公开使用。缺乏安全感的超常发挥者能力出众，野心勃勃，但却深感自己的不足。这通常源于童年，可能由各种因素造成，如经济或物质匮乏的经历，或认为父母的爱取决于自己的行为和表现。

As the recruiters I interviewed explained, these individuals are immensely attractive to elite professional organizations because they are entirely self-motivating and self-disciplining. The firm in effect tells the insecure overachiever, “We are the best in the business, and because we want you to work for us, that makes you the best, too.” But upon joining the firm, insecure overachievers discover that the rigorous up-or-out policy exacerbates their insecurity and their fear of being “exposed” as inadequate — and ultimately rejected.

正如我采访过的招聘人员所解释的那样，这些人对精英职业组织具有巨大的吸引力，因为他们完全是自我激励和自我约束的。公司实际上是在告诉缺乏安全感的超常者："我们是业内最优秀的，因为我们希望你为我们工作，所以你也是最优秀的。但是，缺乏安全感的超常者在加入公司后发现，严格的 "要么上，要么下 "政策加剧了他们的不安全感，使他们害怕 "暴露 "自己的不足，最终被公司拒绝。

The tendency to hard work is reinforced by the strong culture of social control created by elite professional organizations. On the one hand, this is comforting. Some professionals I have studied refer to their firms as being like a “family,” or something even more intense. As one consultant described it, “When I first came here, I thought, This place feels like a cult. But now I have been here a while, I think it is great.” Taken to extremes, the insecure overachiever’s sense of commitment can lead to extreme conformity and the normalization of unhealthy behaviors.

精英职业组织所创造的强大的社会控制文化强化了勤奋工作的倾向。一方面，这令人欣慰。我研究过的一些专业人士称他们的公司就像一个 "大家庭"，甚至更强烈。正如一位顾问所描述的那样："当我第一次来到这里时，我想，这里感觉就像一个邪教组织。但现在我在这里待了一段时间，我觉得这里很棒"。如果走极端，缺乏安全感的 "超常者 "的承诺感会导致极端的顺从和不健康行为的正常化。

If you are a leader who is wondering “Why am I working harder than ever?,” take a good look at yourself, the organization that has created you, and the organizational practices you are perpetuating. Working hard can be rewarding and exhilarating. But consider how you are living. Recognize when you are driving yourself and your staff too hard, and learn how to help yourself and your colleagues to step back from the brink.

如果你是一名领导者，正在思考 "为什么我比以往任何时候都更加努力地工作"，那么请好好审视一下你自己、造就你的组织以及你正在延续的组织惯例。努力工作可以带来回报和振奋。但也要考虑一下自己的生活方式。认识到自己和员工何时过于拼命，并学习如何帮助自己和同事从边缘后退。
