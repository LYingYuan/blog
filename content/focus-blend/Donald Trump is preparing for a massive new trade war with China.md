Publicly, the GOP front-runner has endorsed downgrading China’s trade status with the United States — a move that would lead tariffs between the world’s two largest economies to skyrocket. Revoking China’s status as a “most favored nation” for trade — which is applied to almost all countries the United States trades with — could lead to federal tariffs on Chinese imports of more than 40 percent, according to one analysis. Trump has floated imposing a 10 percent tariff on nearly all $3 trillion in annual imports from all countries, including China.

这位美国共和党的领跑者公开支持降低中国与美国的贸易地位--此举将导致世界上最大的两个经济体之间的关税飙升。根据一项分析，取消中国的贸易 "最惠国待遇"（适用于几乎所有与美国有贸易往来的国家）可能导致联邦对中国进口商品征收 40% 以上的关税。特朗普已提出对包括中国在内的所有国家每年 3 万亿美元的进口商品征收 10% 的关税。

All these options would lead to enormous disruptions to the U.S. and global economies that would far surpass the impact of the trade wars of Trump’s first term, economists of both parties say. Although he often praised Xi Jinping as president and signed a 2020 trade deal with China, Trump now repeatedly bashes Beijing on the campaign trail and has promised a tougher stance than President Biden.

两党的经济学家都表示，所有这些选择都将对美国和全球经济造成巨大破坏，其影响将远远超过特朗普第一任期的贸易战。虽然特朗普在担任总统期间经常称赞习近平，并与中国签署了 2020 年贸易协议，但现在他在竞选活动中一再抨击中国政府，并承诺采取比拜登总统更强硬的立场。

has primarily focused on intensifying policies he pursued during his first term, such as a severe immigration crackdown, cuts to corporate taxes and disruptive new tariffs on U.S. trading partners.

他的主要重点是强化自己在第一任期推行的政策，比如严厉打击移民、削减企业税以及对美国贸易伙伴征收破坏性的新关税。

But Trump’s plans for China may be the most dramatic — and disruptive.

但特朗普对中国的计划可能最引人注目，也最具破坏性。

“I took on Communist China like no administration in history, bringing in hundreds of billions of dollars pouring right into our Treasury when no other president had gotten even literally 10 cents out of China,” Trump said in New Hampshire before he won that state’s primary contest. “Nobody even tried. We took in hundreds of billions of dollars.”

"在赢得新罕布什尔州的初选之前，特朗普在该州的新罕布什尔州说："我像历史上任何一届政府一样打击了共产主义中国，使数千亿美元直接流入我们的国库，而其他任何总统都没有从中国得到过哪怕 10 美分的好处。"没有人尝试过。我们吸收了数千亿美元"。

Most economists say these costs were primarily paid by U.S. consumers and firms, not by China’s government or the Communist Party.

大多数经济学家表示，这些成本主要由美国消费者和企业支付，而不是由中国政府或中国共产党支付。

Policymakers of both parties now argue that China’s economic policies — including artificially devaluing its currency to support exports — have undermined U.S. manufacturing, and Trump sometimes discusses tariffs as a way to force Beijing to change course.

现在，两党的政策制定者都认为，中国的经济政策--包括人为地使货币贬值以支持出口--损害了美国的制造业，特朗普有时会将关税作为迫使中国政府改弦更张的一种方式来讨论。
