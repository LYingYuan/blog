In some ways, today’s internet evermore reminds of the world I encountered back in classical studies. There are bits of papyrus and parchment are flying around everywhere. Some texts claim attribution, some are anonymous, and a lot are pseudonymous—and you can’t tease any of this apart with any certainty. There are competing manuscripts, copies of copies, and significant “versioning issues” everywhere you look. Ultimately, the credence and authority you give to any specific text typically reflects the trust your community bestows on it. The only words that survive are the ones that get copied. This all sounds strangely familiar, yes?

在某些方面，今天的互联网越来越让人想起我在古典研究中遇到的世界。纸莎草和羊皮纸的碎片满天飞。有些文本声称是自己写的，有些是匿名的，还有很多是假名的--而你却无法准确地把它们区分开来。随处可见相互竞争的手稿、抄本的抄本以及重大的 "版本问题"。归根结底，你赋予任何特定文本的可信度和权威性通常反映了你的社区对它的信任。只有被复制的文字才能流传下来。这一切听起来很熟悉，是吗？

And you are fully aware that the more clever and helpful your words are to others, the more likely it is that future readers will attribute your words to someone else.

你完全清楚，你的文字越是巧妙，对他人的帮助越大，未来的读者就越有可能将你的文字归功于他人。

Whether papyrus or the internet, humans doggedly write for influence, status, wealth, conviction, and pleasure.

无论是纸莎草纸还是互联网，人类都在为影响力、地位、财富、信念和快乐而执着地写作。

But the banishment of the author doesn’t mean writing ends. Writers still write even when “authorship” functionally means nothing. And what they write still influences their world, with or without the universe dutifully paying homage to their bylines. In the long arcs of history, what is written typically goes on to mean much more than who wrote it. The future, like today, is built on ideas, not on the people who had them, because people die but ideas never stop evolving.

但作者被放逐并不意味着写作的终结。即使 "作者身份 "毫无意义，作家们依然在写作。无论宇宙是否对他们的署名表示敬意，他们所写的东西仍然影响着他们的世界。在历史的长河中，书写的东西通常比书写者更有意义。未来，就像今天一样，建立在思想之上，而不是建立在拥有思想的人之上，因为人死了，但思想从未停止发展。

So, what’s the fun of writing on the internet anymore? Well, if your aim is to be respected as an author, there’s probably not much fun to be had here at all. Don’t write online for fame and glory. Oblivion, obscurity and exploitation are all but guaranteed. Write here because ideas matter, not authorship. Write here because the more robots, pirates, and single-minded trolls swallow up cyberspace, the more we need independent writing in order to think new thoughts in the future — even if your words are getting dished up and plated by an algorithm.

那么，在互联网上写作还有什么乐趣呢？好吧，如果你的目标是成为受人尊敬的作家，那么这里可能根本没有什么乐趣可言。不要为了名誉和荣誉而在网上写作。湮没无闻、默默无闻和被人利用都是必然的。在这里写作是因为想法很重要，而不是作者身份。在这里写作，是因为机器人、盗版者和一意孤行的巨魔越是吞噬网络空间，我们就越需要独立的写作，以便在未来有新的思想--即使你的文字被算法洗劫一空。

Those who write — those who add ideas instead of paraphrasing and regurgitating them — inform the lexicology and mental corpus of how we think in the future. Indeed, the point isn’t “being an author,” but contributing one’s perspective, even if one’s personal identity is silenced, erased, and anonymized along the way.

那些写作的人--那些补充观点而不是转述和重复观点的人--为我们未来的思维方式提供了词汇和思想基础。事实上，重点不在于 "成为作者"，而在于贡献自己的观点，即使个人身份在写作过程中被沉默、抹杀和匿名化。
