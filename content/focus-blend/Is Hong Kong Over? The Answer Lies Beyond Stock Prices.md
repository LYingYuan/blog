During the pandemic, Hong Kong opened its war chest wide. According to the latest budget figures, by March the city will have burned through 37% of the HK$1.17 trillion ($150 billion) fiscal reserves it had five years ago. A big part of the spending was on consumption vouchers, tax breaks and subsidies to businesses for maintaining headcount. The unemployment rate, which had surged to 8.5% during the SARS epidemic of 2003, peaked at 7.2% in 2021. It has since tapered off to 2.9%. In other words, the administration did ameliorate financial hardship, even though its elusive quest for zero infections was draconian and pointless.

在大流行病期间，香港敞开了它的战备库。根据最新的预算数字，到今年 3 月，香港将耗尽 5 年前 1.17 万亿港元（约合 1,500 亿美元）财政储备的 37%。支出的很大一部分用于消费券、税收减免和对企业维持员工人数的补贴。失业率在 2003 年非典疫情期间飙升至 8.5%，2021 年达到 7.2% 的峰值。此后，失业率逐渐回落至 2.9%。换句话说，政府确实缓解了经济困难，尽管其对零感染的渺茫追求是苛刻和毫无意义的。

This year’s 1 percentage point increase on salary tax above HK$5 million in income takes the top rate to only 16%. Singapore charges its rich 24%.

今年，收入超过 500 万港元的薪俸税增加了 1 个百分点，最高税率仅为 16%。新加坡向富人征收 24% 的税。

Hong Kong is an aging city with the world’s longest life expectancy.

香港是一个老龄化城市，是世界上预期寿命最长的城市。
