过去一年，锂、镍和钴等电池金属分别下跌了 80%、30% 和 25%。用这些金属制成的电池也在朝着同样的方向发展，高盛集团预测，到 2020 年，锂、镍和钴等金属电池的价格将分别下跌 20%、30% 和 25%。

Battery metals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt are down by, respectively, 80%, 30%, and 25% over the past year. The cells made out of them are heading the same direction, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicting a 40% drop in pack prices between 2023 and 2025, putting the global average well below $100 per kilowatt hour.

过去一年，锂、镍和钴等电池金属分别下跌了 80%、30% 和 25%。高盛集团预测，2023 年至 2025 年，电池组价格将下降 40%，全球平均价格将远低于每千瓦时 100 美元。

BYD’s annual results Tuesday confirm the solidity of this shift. It’s a truism in other countries that it’s impossible to turn a profit selling EVs, but even after China abolished purchase subsidies in 2022, BYD’s net income came in at 30.04 billion yuan ($4.16 billion). That’s an 80% increase on the previous year, meaning profit is accelerating faster than the 60% increase in sales volumes.

比亚迪周二公布的年度业绩证实了这一转变的稳固性。在其他国家，销售电动汽车不可能实现盈利已是不争的事实，但即使在中国于 2022 年取消购车补贴后，比亚迪的净收入仍达到 300.4 亿元（41.6 亿美元）。这比上一年增长了 80%，意味着利润增长的速度超过了销量增长 60% 的速度。

This didn’t happen in the middle of a cosy, stitched-up market, either. Savage waves of discounting over the past year have left China’s car sector resembling a battle royale where non-battery cars are being squeezed out by a dizzying array of cheaper, more exciting electric models, even as BYD maintains steady margins that are likely to be around $1,000 per car.

这也并非发生在一个舒适的、缝缝补补的市场中。过去一年里，中国汽车行业掀起了一轮又一轮的打折狂潮，非电池汽车正被一系列令人眼花缭乱的更便宜、更令人兴奋的电动车型所挤压，而比亚迪仍能保持稳定的利润率，每辆车的利润可能在 1000 美元左右。

That’s particularly damaging for offshore brands, who’ve been slow to ramp up their electric offerings. Volkswagen AG’s sales in China last year were their weakest since 2011, while Honda Motor Co. sold the smallest number of vehicles since 2015. Volumes from Nissan Motor Co. and General Motors Co. have fallen about 40% since 2019, when they were respectively the fourth- and sixth-biggest auto brands in the country; neither is even in the top 10 now.

这对海外品牌的影响尤为严重，因为这些品牌在推出电动汽车方面进展缓慢。大众汽车公司去年在中国的销量是自 2011 年以来最弱的一年，而本田汽车公司则是自 2015 年以来销量最少的一年。日产汽车公司和通用汽车公司的销量自 2019 年以来下降了约 40%，当时它们分别是中国第四大和第六大汽车品牌；现在这两家公司甚至都没有进入前十名。
