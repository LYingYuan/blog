Technology has supercharged the country’s surveillance capabilities. But its spying prowess depends on more old-fashioned tools. 

技术为国家的监控能力注入了新的活力。但是，它的间谍能力依赖于更老式的工具。

Over the past decade, the introduction of advanced surveillance technologies in China has given the Chinese Communist Party more power to spy on citizens than any regime in history. Western governments fear this techno-authoritarian model could spread as China sells its gear to developing countries around the world. The US has imposed a slew of restrictions on Chinese companies in part to slow the development and export of such technologies.

过去十年间，中国引进了先进的监控技术，使中国共产党比历史上任何政权都拥有更多监视公民的权力。西方政府担心，随着中国向全球发展中国家出售其设备，这种技术独裁模式可能会蔓延开来。美国对中国公司实施了一系列限制措施，部分目的就是为了减缓此类技术的开发和出口。

Even the fanciest mass surveillance technologies suffer from blind spots and limited coverage. Potential subjects can resort to simple evasive measures such as wearing masks, using burner phones, or turning up the TV volume to thwart listening devices.

即使是最先进的大规模监控技术也存在盲点和覆盖范围有限的问题。潜在目标可以采取简单的规避措施，如戴口罩、使用一次性电话或调高电视音量来阻挠监听设备。

Its singular accomplishment has been the recruitment of millions of informants who perform distinct tasks. As the party maintains cells in local communities, universities, and state-owned enterprises, it has enormous leverage to pressure individuals to act as informants. It can dangle career opportunities and material rewards, or wield implicit threats, to turn ordinary citizens into “ears and eyes” (which is an actual category of police informants) of the state.

该党的独特成就是招募了数百万名线人，这些线人承担着不同的任务。由于该党在地方社区、大学和国有企业中设有基层组织，因此它拥有巨大的影响力来迫使个人充当线人。它可以悬赏职业机会和物质奖励，或进行隐性威胁，将普通公民变成国家的 "耳目"（这是警方线人的一个实际类别）。

Some informants spy on known targets, such as dissidents, noisy petitioners, supposed cult members, and members of ethnic minorities. Others watch critical venues such as hotels, shopping malls, and train stations. Most provide general intelligence on public reaction to government policy and major domestic and international incidents.

一些线人监视已知目标，如持不同政见者、吵闹的上访者、所谓的邪教成员和少数民族成员。其他人则监视酒店、购物中心和火车站等重要场所。大多数人提供的是公众对政府政策和重大国内外事件反应的一般情报。

Based on my research, I would put the number of informants recruited by Chinese police and local authorities at around 14 million people, or 1% of the population, which is close to the ratio in East Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall.

根据我的研究，中国警方和地方当局招募的线人数量约为 1400 万人，占总人口的 1%，接近柏林墙倒塌前东德的线人比例。

The party bureaucracy responsible for security is a Chinese invention, unlike anything in the former Soviet Union or East Germany. Each year, this committee convenes an annual conference to set the agenda for domestic security, issuing directives to state-affiliated entities. It oversees the secret police, as well as new initiatives such as the recent expansion and upgrade of a high-tech surveillance system known as Sharp Eyes.

负责安全的党政机构是中国的发明，与前苏联或东德的任何机构都不同。该委员会每年召开一次年会，制定国内安全议程，并向国家下属机构发布指令。它负责监督秘密警察以及新举措，如最近扩展和升级的高科技监控系统 "锐眼"。

No doubt, China’s high-definition cameras, facial-recognition algorithms, and cloud computing resources will offer autocrats around the world extensive new spying capabilities. Without the political software to go along with the hardware, though, these wannabe surveillance states won’t be as all-seeing as they may hope.

毫无疑问，中国的高清摄像头、面部识别算法和云计算资源将为世界各地的专制者提供广泛的新间谍能力。不过，如果没有与硬件相配套的政治软件，这些想成为监控国家的人也不会像他们希望的那样无所不能。
