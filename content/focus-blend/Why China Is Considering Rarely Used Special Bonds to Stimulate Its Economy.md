China sells general bonds every year to fill the spending gap in its budget. Special sovereign bonds have been issued on rare occasions to raise cash for specific purposes. These — unlike general bonds — are not included in the country’s deficit calculations. Special bonds can also be approved on an ad-hoc basis, such as when the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress — the Communist Party-controlled parliament that oversees government borrowing — meets every two months or so. In contrast, general bonds in most cases need to be factored into the budget and receive approval at the annual NPC meeting.

中国每年都会出售一般债券，以填补预算支出缺口。在极少数情况下，中国会发行特别主权债券，为特定用途筹集现金。与一般债券不同，这些债券不计入国家赤字计算。特别债券也可以临时批准，例如在全国人民代表大会常务委员会（共产党控制的议会，负责监督政府借贷）每两个月左右召开一次会议时。相比之下，一般债券在大多数情况下需要计入预算，并在每年的全国人大会议上获得批准。

Special bonds can help Beijing keep local debt risks under control.

专项债券可以帮助北京控制地方债务风险。

The central government has a much healthier balance sheet than local authorities. The amount of sovereign debt outstanding is around $4 trillion, less than a third of the local debt stockpile including some borrowing by local government financing vehicles, according to Bloomberg calculations based on data from the Ministry of Finance and the International Monetary Fund.

与地方政府相比，中央政府的资产负债表要健康得多。据彭博社根据财政部和国际货币基金组织的数据计算，中国未偿还的主权债务约为 4 万亿美元，不到地方债务（包括地方政府融资工具的部分借款）的三分之一。
