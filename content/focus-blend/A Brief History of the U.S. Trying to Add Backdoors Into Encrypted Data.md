Throughout 2015, U.S. politicians and law enforcement officials such as FBI director James Comey have publicly lobbied for the insertion of cryptographic “backdoors” into software and hardware to allow law enforcement agencies to bypass authentication and access a suspect’s data surreptitiously. Cybersecurity experts have unanimously condemned the idea, pointing out that such backdoors would fundamentally undermine encryption and could exploited by criminals, among other issues. While a legal mandate or public agreement would be needed to allow evidence obtained via backdoors to be admissible in court, the NSA has long attempted—and occasionally succeeded—in placing backdoors for covert activities.

2015 年全年，美国政界人士和联邦调查局局长詹姆斯 - 科米等执法官员公开游说在软件和硬件中插入加密 "后门"，让执法机构绕过身份验证，秘密访问嫌疑人的数据。网络安全专家一致谴责了这一想法，指出这种后门会从根本上破坏加密技术，并可能被犯罪分子利用等问题。虽然通过后门获取的证据需要法律授权或公共协议才能被法庭采纳，但美国国家安全局长期以来一直试图为秘密活动设置后门，并偶尔取得成功。

Although the NSA’s effort puzzled crypto experts, documents leaked by Edward Snowden in 2013 proved that the NSA did indeed build a backdoor into Dual_EC_DRBG and paid RSA, a computer security company, to include the compromised algorithm in its software.

尽管美国国家安全局的努力让密码专家们感到困惑，但爱德华 - 斯诺登在 2013 年泄露的文件证明，美国国家安全局确实在 Dual_EC_DRBG 中建立了一个后门，并付钱给计算机安全公司 RSA，让其在软件中加入被破解的算法。

As our lives become more and more dominated by the digital, security experts have become increasingly vocal in their calls for truly secure encryption, and some governments have begun to listen. Holland’s government has agreed not to use backdoors and support open encryption standards, and despite calls to do so in response to the Paris terrorist attacks, France refuses to implement a backdoor mandate. Even former NSA director Michael Hayden has said that backdoors are a bad idea (and he would know). As Apple vs. FBI wends its way through the courts, we are probably far from the end of this public battle. Whatever the results of this landmark case, the NSA’s classified efforts to subvert cryptography will likely continue.

随着我们的生活越来越被数字化所主宰，安全专家们对真正安全加密的呼声越来越高，一些国家的政府也开始倾听他们的声音。荷兰政府已经同意不使用后门，并支持开放的加密标准，而法国尽管在巴黎恐怖袭击事件中被要求这样做，但仍拒绝执行后门授权。就连美国国家安全局前局长迈克尔 - 海登（Michael Hayden）也说过，后门是个坏主意（他也知道）。随着苹果公司诉联邦调查局案在法庭上的审理，我们可能还远远没有结束这场公众之战。无论这起具有里程碑意义的案件结果如何，美国国家安全局颠覆密码学的机密努力很可能会继续下去。
