The order means that Evergrande, which has been limping along for two years, unable to pay its debts or function normally but still in operation, will now likely face a protracted period dismantling a massive business with projects that span hundreds of cities and unrelated businesses like an electric vehicle company.

过去两年恒大步履蹒跚，无法偿还债务或正常运转，但仍在运营中。该清盘令意味着，恒大在接下来的一段漫长时期里需要拆分这家公司的庞大业务，其项目遍布数百座城市，还有和房地产不相关的业务，例如电动汽车公司。

There isn’t a lot left in Evergrande’s sprawling empire that still has value. And any assets that are valuable may be off limits because property in China has become intertwined with politics.

在恒大庞大的帝国中，有价值的资产所剩无几。就算是有价值的资产可能也指望不上，因为中国的房地产已经与政治交织在一起。

The outcome could help spur or further tamp down the flow of money into Chinese markets when global confidence in China is already shaken.

在全球对中国的信心已经动摇的情况下，这一结果可能会刺激或进一步抑制资金流入中国市场。

China needs investments from foreign investors now more than ever in its recent history.

如今，中国比近代历史上任何时候都更需要外国投资者的投资。

And China’s housing market shows little signs of returning to the boom days, in part because Beijing wants to redirect economic growth from construction and investment.Rising diplomatic tensions between the United States and China, which have led to large outflows of foreign money from China, is not helping.

中国的房地产市场几乎没有恢复繁荣的迹象，部分原因是中国政府希望让经济增长脱离依赖建设和投资的模式。中美外交关系日趋紧张导致大量外资流出中国，也是在火上浇油。
