And their growing popularity — Shein and Temu together send almost 600,000 packages to the U.S. every day, according to a June 2023 report by the U.S. Congress — is boosting air-freight costs from Asian hubs such as Guangzhou and Hong Kong, making off-peak seasons almost disappear and causing capacity shortages, the sources said.

据美国国会 2023 年 6 月的一份报告称，Shein 和 Temu 每天向美国发送近 60 万个包裹，这两家公司日益受到欢迎，这也增加了广州和香港等亚洲枢纽的空运成本，使淡旺季几乎消失，造成运力短缺。

According to data aggregated by Cargo Facts Consulting, Temu ships around 4,000 metric tons a day, Shein 5,000 metric tons, Alibaba 1,000 metric tons and TikTok 800 metric tons. That equates to around 108 Boeing 777 freighters a day, the consultancy said.

根据 Cargo Facts Consulting 收集的数据，Temu 每天的货运量约为 4,000 公吨，Shein 为 5,000 公吨，阿里巴巴为 1,000 公吨，嘀嗒为 800 公吨。该咨询公司称，这相当于每天约 108 架波音 777 货机的运输量。

Fast fashion now accounts for half of China's total cross-border e-commerce shipments and takes up about one-third of global long-distance cargo aircraft, according to cross-border transportation media firm Baixiao.com.

据跨境运输媒体公司百晓网（Baixiao.com）称，快时尚目前占中国跨境电商运输总量的一半，并占据全球长途货运飞机的三分之一。

A German logistics source said even large tech firms such as Apple transport only 1,000 tons maximum a day and the growing cargo demand from fast fashion could push out traditional long-term customers, as they vie for limited air capacity.

一位德国物流业人士说，即使是苹果公司这样的大型科技公司，每天最多也只能运输 1000 吨货物，而快速时尚日益增长的货运需求可能会挤走传统的长期客户，因为他们要争夺有限的航空运力。

Niall van de Wouw, chief air freight officer for air and ocean freight rate benchmarking platform Xeneta, said fast-fashion brands were causing a "trade imbalance" with large amounts of cargo leaving Hong Kong but merchandise volumes being "much lower on the journey back across the Pacific."

空运和海运费率基准平台 Xeneta 的首席空运官 Niall van de Wouw 说，快速时尚品牌正在造成 "贸易不平衡"，大量货物离开香港，但 "在穿越太平洋返回的途中，商品量却低得多"。

The impact of China's new e-commerce giants is "game-changing," said Schlossberg. "They ... are emerging as the most important drivers in the industry."

中国新兴电子商务巨头的影响 "改变了游戏规则"，施洛斯伯格说。"它们......正在成为行业最重要的推动力。
