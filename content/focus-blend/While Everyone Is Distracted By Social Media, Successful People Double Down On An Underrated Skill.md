“The information we consume matters just as much as the food we put in our body. It affects our thinking, our behavior, how we understand our place in the world. And how we understand others.”
— Evan Williams, Co-Founder of Twitter and Medium
“我们摄入的信息与我们吃进身体的食物一样重要。它影响我们的思维、行为，影响我们如何理解自己在世界上的位置。以及我们如何理解他人。”
--埃文 威廉姆斯，Twitter 和 Medium 联合创始人

Right now, somewhere out in the world is a paragraph, chapter, or book that would change your life forever if you read it. I call this kind of information “breakthrough knowledge,” and mastering the ability to find breakthrough knowledge in our era of information overload is one of the most important skills we can develop.

此时此刻，在世界的某个角落，有一个段落、一个章节或一本书，如果你读了，它将永远改变你的生活。我把这种信息称为 "突破性知识"，在我们这个信息过载的时代，掌握寻找突破性知识的能力是我们可以培养的最重要的技能之一。

We’ve all had breakthrough experiences. A phrase that a parent, mentor, or teacher said that stuck with us and changed everything. A “quake” book that shook us to our core.

我们都有过突破性的经历。父母、导师或老师说过的一句话让我们难以忘怀，并改变了一切。一本 "震撼 "我们心灵的书。

The four problems that make up the Info-Apocalypse are:

1. Content Shock
2. Echo Chambers
3. Constant Distraction
4. FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)

The problem: Each group lives in its own echo chamber, which it believes is the “true” reality, and it fights to maintain this belief by demonizing other groups. And in an age of social media and targeted, personalized content, these echo chambers become even more insular (see The Filter Bubble for more on this), as we’re exposed to less and less information outside our own chosen groups.

问题在于：每个群体都生活在自己的 "回音室 "中，认为自己的 "回音室 "才是 "真正的 "现实，并通过妖魔化其他群体来维持这种信念。在社交媒体和有针对性的个性化内容时代，这些回音室变得更加封闭（更多信息请参阅《过滤泡沫》），因为我们接触到的自己选择的群体之外的信息越来越少。

Let’s say I want to learn videography. Twenty years ago, I would’ve had to find a local class or read a book. Today, I can go on to YouTube and sort through one of the 277,000 results that come up for “learn videography.” Or I can literally sign up for an $180 all-access pass on Masterclass and learn directing from Ron Howard, screenwriting from Aaron Sorkin, or filmmaking from Martin Scorsese. On this level — and if we’re careful about what we consume — we actually live in an information utopia.

比方说，我想学习摄像。二十年前，我不得不在当地找一个培训班或读一本书。如今，我可以上 YouTube，在 27.7 万个 "学习摄像 "的结果中选择一个。或者，我也可以在 Masterclass 上注册一个 180 美元的全通票，向罗恩 - 霍华德（Ron Howard）学习导演，向亚伦 - 索金（Aaron Sorkin）学习编剧，或向马丁 - 斯科塞斯（Martin Scorsese）学习电影制作。在这个层面上--如果我们对自己的消费保持谨慎的话--我们实际上生活在一个信息乌托邦里。

One lineage of solutions has been knowledge formats that have a higher value-density:

解决方案之一是具有较高价值密度的知识格式：

A social media post is usually a writer’s best thought of the day — or in some cases their best thought of the month if they are posting a long article.

社交媒体上的文章通常是作者一天中最好的想法，如果是长篇文章，有时也是一个月中最好的想法。

A book is much more valuable because it contains an author’s best thoughts of the decade or year. It’s also vetted, approved, and edited.

一本书之所以更有价值，是因为它包含了作者在十年或一年中的最佳思想。它还经过审核、批准和编辑。

Book summaries are even more valuable. Over the last five years, we’ve seen the rise of a cottage industry of these summaries. Search for any bestseller on Amazon, and it’s likely you’ll see a few book summaries for purchase. Search on Google, and you’ll see several for free. Services like Blinkist and Get Abstract have catalogued thousands of book summaries in audio and text format. Book summaries are valuable because not all information within a book is created equal. They provide the most concise description of the book’s main ideas, stories, exercises, and takeaways. In this category, I would also include author presentations (e.g., TEDx Talks, Google Talks) and author interviews (e.g., podcasts) on the book. Each of these are condensed overviews of the book.

书籍摘要更有价值。在过去的五年里，我们已经看到这种摘要的山寨产业正在崛起。在亚马逊上搜索任何畅销书，你很可能会看到一些供购买的书摘。在谷歌上搜索，你会看到一些免费的摘要。像 Blinkist 和 Get Abstract 这样的服务机构已经为成千上万的音频和文本格式的书籍摘要编了目录。书籍摘要很有价值，因为一本书中的所有信息并非都一样。它们最简洁地描述了书中的主要观点、故事、练习和收获。在这个类别中，我还会包括作者演讲（如 TEDx 演讲、Google 演讲）和作者访谈（如播客）。这些都是对本书的浓缩概述。

Field summaries condense whole fields. The best example is the For Dummies guides. Since they were started nearly 30 years ago, they have sold 200 million copies of 2,500+ titles, making them one of the bestselling series of all time.

领域摘要浓缩了整个领域。最好的例子就是《傻瓜指南》。自近 30 年前问世以来，这套丛书已售出 2,500 多本，销量达 2 亿册，成为有史以来最畅销的丛书之一。
