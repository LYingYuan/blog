But I need to remember, now and again, that Apple is a corporation, and corporations aren’t people, and they can’t love you back. You wouldn’t love GE or Exxon or Comcast — and you shouldn’t love Apple. It’s not an exception to the rule: there are no exceptions.

但我得时不时提醒自己，苹果是一家公司，公司不是人，它们无法回应你的爱。你不会爱通用电气、埃克森或康卡斯特，你也不应该爱苹果。这不是规则的例外：没有例外。
