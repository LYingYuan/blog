As China's housing demand will likely fall further due to a shrinking population and rising living standards, the world is bracing for a surge in exports of cheap building materials from the country.

由于人口减少和生活水平提高，中国的住房需求可能会进一步下降，全世界都在为中国廉价建筑材料的出口激增做好准备。

Intense price-cutting competition is underway as the country's housing market becomes saturated. The level of excess stock, calculated by subtracting all the residential floor space sold from the total area of homes built, reached just under 5 billion sq. meters at the end of 2023. Assuming each home has a floor space of 100 sq. meters and three family members, China now has excess space to house 150 million people, equal to about 50 million homes.

随着国内住房市场趋于饱和，激烈的降价竞争正在进行。从已建住宅总面积中减去所有已售住宅建筑面积计算得出的过剩存量水平，到 2023 年底将略低于 50 亿平方米。假设每套住宅的建筑面积为 100 平方米，家庭成员为三人，那么中国目前的过剩面积可容纳 1.5 亿人，相当于约 5000 万套住宅。

The home-building binge subsided after the country began to tighten regulations in 2020. But inventories remain high due to sluggish sales. The amount of residential floor space sold in 2023 totaled 940 million sq. meters, down about 40% from a peak of 1.56 billion sq. meters in 2021.

在国家于 2020 年开始收紧法规后，住房建设热潮有所减退。但由于销售低迷，库存仍然居高不下。2023 年的住宅销售面积为 9.4 亿平方米，与 2021 年 15.6 亿平方米的峰值相比下降了约 40%。

In 2020, China had more than 220 million people in their 30s -- potential first-time homebuyers -- but the number is expected to fall below 160 million in 2035. A study by Harvard University professor Kenneth Rogoff and others forecast that the number of urban housing starts continues to fall at an annual rate of 3% through 2035.

2020 年，中国 30 多岁的潜在首次购房者超过 2.2 亿人，但预计到 2035 年，这一数字将降至 1.6 亿人以下。哈佛大学教授肯尼斯 - 罗格夫（Kenneth Rogoff）等人的研究预测，到 2035 年，城市住房开工数量将继续以每年 3% 的速度下降。

China's housing glut is causing downward pressure on international commodity prices. Prices of such key housing materials as steel bars and copper on the futures market tend to move in tandem with property investment, which has fallen sharply since the spring of 2022.

中国住房供应过剩给国际大宗商品价格带来下行压力。钢筋和铜等主要住房材料在期货市场上的价格往往与房地产投资同步变动，而房地产投资自 2022 年春季以来已大幅下降。

However, demand for copper is growing, as it is used in electric vehicles and other eco-friendly products. Weak housing demand in China would keep copper prices in check, helping global decarbonization efforts, but the world remains wary of a possible increase in exports of cheap building materials from China.

然而，由于铜被用于电动汽车和其他环保产品，对铜的需求正在增长。中国住房需求疲软将抑制铜价，有助于全球去碳化努力，但世界仍对中国可能增加廉价建材出口保持警惕。

In the January-September period of 2023, nearly 80% of 45 listed Chinese steelmakers either fell into the red or logged net profit declines. Exports of steel products from China for the full year totaled 90 million metric tons, up more than 20 million metric tons from the previous year, according to the China Iron and Steel Association. "Higher exports eased oversupply," said Tan Chengxu, vice chairman of the association.

2023 年 1 月至 9 月，中国 45 家上市钢铁企业中有近 80% 的企业出现亏损或净利润下降。中国钢铁工业协会的数据显示，全年中国钢铁产品出口总量为 9000 万吨，比上年增加 2000 多万吨。"中国钢铁工业协会副会长谭成旭说："出口增加缓解了供过于求的局面。

Mexico has already raised tariffs on steel and related products to protect its industry from a possible onslaught of Chinese imports. The world's second-largest economy also has large production capacities in aluminum and cement. The collapse of China's housing bubble is no longer just a domestic headache.

墨西哥已经提高了钢铁和相关产品的关税，以保护本国工业免受中国进口产品可能带来的冲击。这个世界第二大经济体还拥有庞大的铝和水泥生产能力。中国房地产泡沫的崩溃已不再仅仅是国内头疼的问题。
