And rather than this being pure skullduggery, people and institutions are willing to embrace low-quality AI-generated content, trying to shift the Overton window to make things like this acceptable.

与其说这纯粹是耍滑头，不如说人们和机构愿意接受低质量的人工智能生成的内容，试图改变奥弗顿窗口，让这样的事情变得可以接受。

AI pollution is a tragedy of the commons.

人工智能污染是公地悲剧。

… the tragedy of the commons reappears in problems of pollution. Here it is not a question of taking something out of the commons, but of putting something in—sewage, or chemical, radioactive, and heat wastes into water; noxious and dangerous fumes into the air; and distracting and unpleasant advertising signs into the line of sight. The calculations of utility are much the same as before. The rational man finds that his share of the cost of the wastes he discharges into the commons is less than the cost of purifying his wastes before releasing them. Since this is true for everyone, we are locked into a system of "fouling our own nest," so long as we behave only as independent, rational, free-enterprisers.

......公地的悲剧再次出现在污染问题上。在这里，问题不是从公有资源中拿出什么东西，而是放进什么东西--污水或化学、放射性和热能废物进入水中；有毒和危险的烟雾进入空气中；令人心烦意乱和不愉快的广告标志进入人们的视线。对效用的计算与以前大致相同。理性的人发现，他排放到公共资源中的废物的成本份额小于在排放废物之前净化废物的成本。由于每个人都是如此，只要我们的行为是独立、理性和自由的，我们就会被锁定在一个 "自扫门前雪 "的系统中。

Luckily we’re on the cusp of all that incredibly futuristic technology promised by AI. Any day now, our GDP will start to rocket forward. In fact, soon we’ll cure all disease, even aging itself, and have robot butlers and Universal Basic Income and high-definition personalized entertainment. Who cares if toddlers had to watch inhuman runoff for a few billion years of viewing-time to make the future happen? It was all worth it. Right? Let’s wait a little bit longer. If we wait just a little longer utopia will surely come.

幸运的是，我们正处在人工智能所承诺的所有不可思议的未来技术的风口浪尖上。从现在开始，我们的 GDP 将以火箭般的速度飞速增长。事实上，我们很快就能治愈所有疾病，甚至衰老本身，拥有机器人管家、全民基本收入和高清个性化娱乐。谁会在乎幼儿为了实现未来而不得不在几十亿年的观看时间里观看非人类的径流呢？这一切都是值得的。对吧？让我们再等一等。只要再等一等，乌托邦就一定会到来。
