It seems cosmically unfair – we have fewer years to live, and each year flies by faster.

这似乎是宇宙的不公平--我们的寿命越来越少，而每一年都过得很快。

If an event has happened before, what’s the point of paying attention to it and storing it in memory? Redundant storage is inefficient, so the brain likely only pays attention to and memorises what’s new and surprising.

如果一个事件已经发生过，那么关注它并将其存储在记忆中又有什么意义呢？冗余存储的效率很低，因此大脑很可能只关注和记忆新奇的东西。

As kids, everything is new and surprising. The world is full of learning opportunities, so the brain makes massive updates in memories.

作为孩子，一切都是新鲜的、令人惊讶的。世界充满了学习机会，因此大脑会对记忆进行大量更新。

As we grow, new surprises become a merely tiny-patch on an old memory.

随着我们的成长，新的惊喜只是旧记忆上的一小块补丁。

As patterns in life start repeating themselves, the slices-of-time that you notice and memorise become fewer and coarser.

随着生活模式的不断重复，你所注意和记忆的时间片段也会变得越来越少，越来越粗糙。

Naturally, if anyone asks where did time in your life go, you’d access your memory and find ** the majority of them relating to childhood, and very few from the recent times.**

自然，如果有人问你生活中的时间都去哪儿了，你会调取记忆，**发现大部分都与童年有关，很少有近期的**。

The main culprit in time-speeding up is predictability. The more predictable your days are, the shorter they will feel.

加快时间的罪魁祸首是可预测性。你的日子越可预测，就会感觉越短。

So, predictability not just impacts perception of time in the present but also for the future. As kids, a vacation was full of surprising information, so it actually felt rich and long. Now, your nth trip to Goa feels much shorter as you know what you’re going to do.

因此，可预测性不仅会影响对当前时间的感知，还会影响对未来时间的感知。在孩提时代，一个假期充满了令人惊喜的信息，所以它实际上是丰富而漫长的。现在，您的第 n 次果阿之旅感觉短多了，因为您知道自己要做什么。

So, what to do? How to slow down time? The only approach I can think of is to break the predictability and actively plan to be (massively) surprised. Take on projects that you have no idea about. Unfortunately, we are evolved to avoid exploring and taking risks as we age. **Our brain pushes us to exploit more of the world we have come to understand better instead of pushing us to explore more.**

那么，该怎么办？如何让时间慢下来？我能想到的唯一办法就是打破可预测性，积极计划（大）惊喜。承担您完全不了解的项目。不幸的是，随着年龄的增长，我们开始避免探索和冒险。**我们的大脑会促使我们更多地利用我们已经更加了解的世界，而不是促使我们去探索更多**。

**That is, to travel physically or mentally.**

**即身体或精神旅行**
