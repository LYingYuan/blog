The southeastern province merged its military-civil fusion office, which is tasked with integrating civilian resources as part of China’s military build-up, with its defence mobilisation department in a structural reform this week, according to Fujian’s provincial government website.

据福建省政府网站报道，在本周的一项机构改革中，东南部省份将负责整合民用资源的军民融合办公室与国防动员部门合并。

One major change under the reform was to have provincial governments take over coordination of defence mobilisation from local military districts, which previously oversaw the task. The provincial governments, which can more easily coordinate between different administrative agencies, are expected to be able to carry out mobilisation more efficiently.

改革中的一个重大变化是由省级政府从地方军区接管国防动员的协调工作。省政府可以更容易地协调不同行政机构之间的关系，因此有望更有效地开展动员工作。
