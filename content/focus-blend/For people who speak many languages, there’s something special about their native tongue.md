The findings suggest there is something unique about the first language one acquires, which allows the brain to process it with minimal effort, the researchers say.

研究人员说，这些发现表明，一个人掌握的第一门语言有其独特之处，它能让大脑以最小的代价处理语言。

The researchers saw a similar phenomenon when polyglots listened to languages that they don’t speak: Their language network was more engaged when listening to languages related to a language that they could understand, than compared to listening to completely unfamiliar languages.

研究人员在多语言者听他们不会说的语言时也发现了类似的现象：与聆听完全陌生的语言相比，在聆听与他们能听懂的语言相关的语言时，他们的语言网络参与度更高。
