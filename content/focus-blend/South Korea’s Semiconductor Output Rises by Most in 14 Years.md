South Korea’s output of semiconductors jumped the most in 14 years in February in an indication of ongoing recovery in the country’s most important industrial sector and global tech demand.

韩国 2 月份的半导体产量创下 14 年来最大增幅，表明该国最重要的工业部门和全球科技需求正在持续复苏。

Production jumped 65.3% from a year earlier, the biggest rise since late 2009, according to data released Friday by the national statistics agency. Shipments of semiconductors also rose 59%, even though it was weaker than 62.7% in January. Inventory shrank 16.2%, falling for a second month in another sign of strong demand.

国家统计局周五公布的数据显示，韩国的半导体产量比去年同期增长了 65.3%，这是自 2009 年底以来的最大增幅。半导体的出货量也增长了 59%，尽管这一增长率低于 1 月份的 62.7%。库存减少了 16.2%，连续第二个月下降，这也是需求强劲的另一个迹象。
