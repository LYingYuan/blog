He added that China-US tensions are causing foreign investors to diversify or leave China for fear of being discriminated against. That’s causing China to face difficulties obtaining investments, and without a reconciliation of economic and cultural clashes, the chance of a war in the next 10 years is high.

他补充说，中美紧张关系正导致外国投资者因担心受到歧视而分散投资或离开中国。这使中国在获得投资方面面临困难，如果经济和文化冲突得不到调和，未来十年发生战争的可能性很高。

To manage its debt problem, Dalio recommends that China engineer a deleveraging and an easing of monetary policy at the same time, but acknowledges that such a move would be difficult and politically dangerous as it would lead to big changes in wealth levels.

为了解决债务问题，达里奥建议中国同时采取去杠杆化和放松货币政策的措施，但他也承认，这样做很困难，在政治上也很危险，因为这会导致财富水平发生巨大变化。

“No one knows how far the pendulum will swing back toward the more Maoist/Marxist ways of doing things,” Dalio wrote. “The impediment is that communicating more directly is not the Chinese leadership’s traditional way of doing things, which, as China goes back toward the more traditional ways of doing things, is understandable.”

"达里奥写道："没有人知道钟摆会朝着更毛泽东/马克思主义的做事方式摆回多远。"障碍在于，更直接的沟通并不是中国领导层的传统做事方式，随着中国向更传统的做事方式回归，这是可以理解的"。
