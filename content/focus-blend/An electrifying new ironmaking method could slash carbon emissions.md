Making iron, the main ingredient of steel, takes a toll on Earth’s delicate atmosphere, producing 8% of all global greenhouse gas emissions. Now, a team of chemists has come up with a way to make the business much more eco-friendly. By using electricity to convert iron ore and salt water into metallic iron and other industrially useful chemicals, researchers report today in Joule that their approach is cost effective, works well with electricity provided by wind and solar farms, and could even be carbon negative, consuming more carbon dioxide (CO2) than it produces.

炼铁是钢铁的主要成分，它对地球脆弱的大气层造成了破坏，产生的温室气体占全球总排放量的 8%。现在，一个化学家团队想出了一种方法，让这项业务变得更加环保。研究人员在今天的《焦耳》（Joule）杂志上报告说，他们利用电力将铁矿石和盐水转化为金属铁和其他对工业有用的化学物质，这种方法成本效益高，与风能和太阳能发电场提供的电力配合良好，甚至可以实现负碳排放，消耗的二氧化碳（CO 2）比产生的还多。
