Iron ore futures fell below $100 a ton for the first time in seven months as investors bet that China’s years-long property crisis will run through 2024, keeping a lid on steel demand.

铁矿石期货七个月来首次跌破每吨 100 美元，原因是投资者押注中国长达数年的房地产危机将持续到 2024 年，从而抑制了钢铁需求。

The steelmaking ingredient has shed more than 30% since early January as hopes of a meaningful revival in construction activity faded. Loss-making steel mills are buying less ore, and stockpiles are piling up at Chinese ports.

自 1 月初以来，随着建筑活动出现实质性复苏的希望逐渐破灭，炼钢原料的价格下跌了 30% 以上。亏损的钢厂减少了对矿石的购买，中国港口的矿石库存堆积如山。

The price rout deepened this week on more signs of demand weakness. Chinese steel mills are starting to announce production cuts as spot steel prices are falling. The poor performance this year is a reversal from 2023, when iron ore outpaced base metals and other commodities to rack up a gain of 20%.

本周，由于需求疲软的迹象增多，钢价跌势加剧。在现货钢价下跌之际，中国钢厂开始宣布减产。今年的糟糕表现与 2023 年的情况截然相反，当时铁矿石的涨幅超过了基本金属和其他大宗商品，达到了 20%。

“The market sentiment is a bit extreme at the moment,” said Wei Xinyue, an analyst with Horizon Insights. “Chinese molten iron output is falling instead of rebounding. Steel demand has been significantly weaker than expected.”

"Horizon Insights 的分析师 Wei Xinyue 说："目前的市场情绪有点极端。"中国的铁水产量不升反降。钢铁需求明显弱于预期。"
