This is the 21st-century vision of play: it’s safe, organised, educational, always supervised by adults. And it might have killed off what we used to think of as play: kids running around whatever space they could find, improvising unpredictable games and creating social worlds unfathomable to their parents.

这就是 21 世纪的游戏观：安全、有组织、有教育意义，并且始终由成人监督。这可能会扼杀我们过去所认为的游戏：孩子们在他们能找到的任何空间里奔跑，即兴玩着不可预知的游戏，创造出父母们无法想象的社交世界。

Dutch cultural theorist Johan Huizinga saw play as primal: just like any other young animal, children have an intrinsic drive to play, and don’t need to be taught how to do it. Huizinga defines play as an act of self-directed freedom. It can only really happen when children are left to their own devices, which requires parents to ignore them.

荷兰文化理论家约翰 - 惠伊辛加（Johan Huizinga）认为游戏是最原始的：就像任何其他年幼的动物一样，儿童有游戏的内在驱动力，不需要教他们如何去做。Huizinga 将游戏定义为一种自主自由的行为。只有让孩子们自己去玩，这才是真正的游戏，这就需要父母不理会他们。

Parents worry that boredom is bad — when actually, it is an important learning experience. It’s a transitional space in which the child realises that she needs to do something differently. She might then try to attract a parent’s attention. If she doesn’t get it, she gets fractious; if she is still ignored, she eventually finds something else to do. If we leave that novelty-seeking impulse to develop, it turns into creativity. It just needs time.

家长们担心无聊是坏事--而实际上，无聊是一种重要的学习体验。这是一个过渡空间，在这个空间里，孩子意识到她需要做一些不同的事情。这时，她可能会试图吸引父母的注意。如果没有得到关注，她就会变得暴躁；如果仍然被忽视，她最终会找到其他事情做。如果我们让这种追求新奇的冲动发展下去，它就会变成创造力。只是需要时间。

In other words, play is a good warm-up for life. But, crucially, it doesn’t take place for material or real-world gain. The goals exist outside of the goals we ordinarily strive for, and they evaporate. Kids need to be emotionally committed enough to want to win, but not so invested that they kick off when they don’t. At a time when children spend years of their lives being examined and graded in school, there’s benefit in both learning to strive and learning to let go.

换句话说，游戏是生活的良好热身。但最关键的是，游戏不是为了物质或现实世界的利益。这些目标存在于我们通常所追求的目标之外，它们会烟消云散。孩子们需要有足够的情感投入，希望赢得比赛，但又不至于太投入，以至于在比赛失败时一蹶不振。当孩子们花费数年时间在学校里接受考验和评分时，学会奋斗和学会放手都是有益的。

True play also teaches kids how to deal with uncertainty.

真正的游戏还能教会孩子们如何应对不确定性。

Play isn’t predetermined, but animated by chaos. Hence why play necessarily comes with risk.

游戏不是预设的，而是由混沌激发的。

Whereas Huizinga argued that play happens outside of ordinary life — and is therefore a kind of anarchy — pseudo-play conforms entirely to conventional structures, whether it’s the gaming-industrial complex or the lifestyle capitalism promoting Important Experiences.

惠津加认为，游戏发生在普通生活之外，因此是一种无政府状态，而伪游戏则完全符合传统结构，无论是游戏工业综合体还是推广重要体验的生活方式资本主义。

If we lose autonomy, we tend to lose faith in ourselves.

如果我们失去了自主权，我们往往会对自己失去信心。

We’ve survived as a species by being creative, so regain it we must, or else.
