**True learning can only happen on campuses where academic freedom is paramount — within and outside the classroom.**

**真正的学习只能在学术自由至上的校园里发生，无论是在课堂内还是课堂外。**

A goal of higher education must be to train our students (and often ourselves) away from re-enacting endlessly the famous 1954 experiment by Albert H. Hastorf and Hadley Cantril, in which students at Dartmouth and Princeton watched a film of a penalty-ridden football game between the two schools. When questioned about what they witnessed, each side’s partisans saw mainly the fouls committed by their opponents.

高等教育的一个目标必须是训练我们的学生（往往也包括我们自己），使他们不再无休止地重演阿尔伯特-H-哈斯托夫（Albert H. Hastorf）和哈德利 - 坎特里尔（Hadley Cantril）在 1954 年进行的著名实验，在该实验中，达特茅斯大学和普林斯顿大学的学生观看了两校之间一场点球大战的录像。当被问及他们看到了什么时，双方的支持者主要看到了对手的犯规。

The university classroom is the place to press students to look for more.

大学课堂是促使学生追求更多的地方。

The difficulty stems, as my Yale Law School colleague Anthony Kronman has accurately noted, from the yielding of universities to the “vocational ideal,” the notion that what’s most important in life is work (together with the wallet), and concomitantly that the purpose of higher education is to inculcate the skills needed to excel in the labor market. In short, college as a path to a better job and a higher income.

正如我在耶鲁大学法学院的同事安东尼 - 克罗曼（Anthony Kronman）所准确指出的那样，困难源于大学对 "职业理想 "的屈服，即认为生活中最重要的是工作（连同钱包），同时高等教育的目的是灌输在劳动力市场中脱颖而出所需的技能。简而言之，大学是通往更好工作和更高收入的道路。

For if the purpose of the university classroom is simply to impart information, digital agents will soon perform the task better than experienced teachers, and colleges will find themselves unnecessary, merely duplicative of what students can get at home, cheaply and efficiently.

因为如果大学课堂的目的仅仅是传授信息，那么数字代理很快就会比有经验的教师更出色地完成任务，而大学将发现自己没有必要，只是重复了学生在家里可以廉价高效地获得的东西。

The classroom is, first and foremost, a place to train young minds toward a yearning for knowledge and a taste for argument — to be intellectually curious — even if what they wind up discovering challenges their most cherished convictions. If the behavioral economist George Loewenstein is right that curiosity is a result of an “information gap” — a desire to know more than we do — then the most vital tasks of higher education are to help students realize that the gap always exists and to stoke their desire to bridge it.

课堂首先是一个培养年轻人渴望知识、喜欢争论--对知识充满好奇--的地方，即使他们最终发现的东西挑战了他们最珍视的信念。如果行为经济学家乔治 - 卢温斯坦（George Loewenstein）的观点是正确的，即好奇心是 "信息鸿沟 "的结果--一种比我们知道得更多的欲望，那么高等教育最重要的任务就是帮助学生认识到鸿沟始终存在，并激发他们弥合鸿沟的欲望。

Impediments to free speech are impediments to free thought and can only interfere with that search. That’s why academic freedom is so precious.

对言论自由的阻碍就是对自由思想的阻碍，只会干扰这种探索。这就是学术自由如此珍贵的原因。

But I’m not at all sure the college classroom should be a place of comfort. It should be a place, rather, where students regularly face the challenge of difficult questions, as their professors help prepare them for the life of the mind. The more successful the teaching, the more students will carry their taste for the give-and-take of argument out of the classroom and into the larger world.

但我一点也不确定大学课堂应该是一个舒适的地方。相反，它应该是一个让学生经常面对难题挑战的地方，因为他们的教授会帮助他们为思想生活做好准备。教学越成功，学生们就越能将他们对争论的喜好带出课堂，带入更广阔的世界。

What campuses need is less regulation of speech, not more.

校园需要的是减少而不是增加对言论的管制。

I agree with the philosopher Seana Valentine Shiffrin that when we search for the justifications for free speech, we tend to overlook its value in crafting our own identities, the way that a self can try on ideas like clothes, to discover which fit best. Sometimes the ideas will be beautiful; sometimes they’ll be ugly; sometimes they’ll look better on one person than another.

我同意哲学家西娜 - 瓦伦丁 - 希夫林（Seana Valentine Shiffrin）的观点，当我们为言论自由寻找理由时，我们往往忽视了它在塑造我们自身身份方面的价值，即一个人可以像试穿衣服一样试穿各种想法，以发现哪件最合身。有时候，这些想法会很美；有时候，它们会很丑；有时候，它们穿在一个人身上会比穿在另一个人身上更好看。

This process of testing ideas should be encouraged, particularly among the young. But it carries risks, not least because of what we might call influencers, who wind up dictating which ideas it’s fashionable to wear and which should be tossed out. When large majorities of college students report pressure to self-censor, this is what they’re talking about. Surveys suggest that the principal reason students keep controversial ideas to themselves is to avoid the disdain not of their professors but of their peers.

这种检验想法的过程应该受到鼓励，尤其是在年轻人中间。但它也有风险，尤其是因为我们可以称之为 "影响者 "的人，他们最终会决定哪些想法是时髦的，哪些应该被抛弃。当大多数大学生表示有自我审查的压力时，他们说的就是这种情况。调查显示，学生们之所以对有争议的观点守口如瓶，主要是为了避免遭到教授和同学们的鄙视。

But I didn’t want to see him punished. I wanted to see him refuted.

但我不想看到他受到惩罚。我想看到他被驳倒。

Interrupting classes, making noise so that others can’t hear speakers, blocking access, taking over buildings — all of these are less acts of dissent than assertions of raw power.

打断课堂、制造噪音让别人听不到演讲、阻塞通道、占领教学楼--所有这些与其说是异议行为，不如说是原始权力的宣示。

A student who takes an ugly position should be tolerated. A student who tries to prevent someone else’s ugly position from being heard should be suspended.

对持丑恶立场的学生应该宽容。试图阻止别人表达丑陋立场的学生应该被停学。

On campus, at least, you should be able to support Israel in the Gaza War, yet feel free to argue that the Israelis have prosecuted the conflict too aggressively; or to support the aspirations of the Palestinians, yet be willing to condemn unequivocally Oct. 7.

少在校园里，你应该能够在加沙战争中支持以色列，但也可以认为以色列在冲突中表现得过于激进；或者支持巴勒斯坦人的愿望，但也可以毫不含糊地谴责 10 月 7 日的行动。

Hanging out only with those they already agree with is one of the worst ways for young people to waste their years on campus.

只与自己已经认同的人来往，是年轻人在校园里虚度光阴的最糟糕方式之一。

Should the scope of campus debate be unlimited? Of course not. There will of necessity always be a palisade marking the boundary line of civilized conversation, and some opinions will always rest in the wilderness beyond freedom’s protection.

校园辩论的范围应该是无限的吗？当然不是。在文明对话的边界线上，必然会有一道栅栏，而有些观点总是处于自由保护之外的荒野之中。

I’ve argued elsewhere that each generation should be permitted to place, at most, one issue beyond the fence. I believe it still. But that exclusion should follow, not precede, the waves of social change. Especially today, as the world teems with ferment, as every activist left or right pushes to move this issue or that outside the universe of rational discourse, the academy must be the last to yield.

我曾在其他地方论证过，每一代人最多只能将一个问题置于栅栏之外。我现在仍然这么认为。但是，这种排斥应该在社会变革的浪潮之后，而不是之前。尤其是在今天，当世界充斥着各种发酵，当每一个左翼或右翼的激进分子都在推动将这个或那个问题置于理性讨论的范围之外时，学术界必须是最后一个让步的。
