And yet, for all the cultural and economic adjustments immigration may require, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that, for many countries, high rates of immigration are simply flat-out necessary.

然而，尽管移民可能需要在文化和经济上进行调整，但很难避免得出这样的结论：对许多国家来说，高移民率是完全必要的。

In Canada, for instance, the current fertility rate is about 1.33 children per woman, the lowest on record, and it probably would have been lower yet without recent immigrant arrivals. Canada’s geography also argues for more immigration. It is likely to have much more usable territory, due to global warming, so a much larger population is feasible. If Canada wants to maintain a reasonable balance of power with the US, and have the resources to develop and protect its Arctic and Arctic-adjacent areas, it needs a commensurately large population and economy.

以加拿大为例，目前的生育率约为每名妇女 1.33 个孩子，是有记录以来的最低水平，如果没有新移民的到来，生育率可能还会更低。加拿大的地理位置也支持更多的移民。由于全球变暖，加拿大可能会拥有更多可用的领土，因此可以拥有更多的人口。如果加拿大希望与美国保持合理的力量平衡，并有足够的资源开发和保护其北极及北极附近地区，那么它就需要有相应规模的人口和经济。

To put the point more generally: Whatever costs there might be to immigration, successful nations will have to deal with them sooner or later. And the sooner they do, the better off they will be. The choice is not so much between more immigration and less immigration, but rather a lot of immigration now or a lot later. This choice will become all the more pressing as the need to fund national retirement programs requires more tax-paying citizens.

更笼统地说：无论移民需要付出什么代价，成功的国家迟早都要面对这些代价。而且越早处理，他们的境况就会越好。与其说是在增加移民还是减少移民之间做出选择，不如说是在现在大量移民还是以后大量移民之间做出选择。随着国家退休计划的资金需求需要更多的纳税公民，这种选择将变得更加紧迫。

One of the most common criticisms of immigrants is that they push up real estate prices. Yet there is a home-grown explanation: Stringent regulations on building make it difficult for the supply of housing to respond when demand increases.

对移民最常见的批评之一就是他们推高了房地产价格。然而，有一种本土的解释：严格的建筑法规使得住房供应难以在需求增加时做出反应。

In fact, there is a way immigration can help address this problem. First, immigrants may themselves induce their adopted country to free up its real estate markets. So immigration might increase real estate costs in the short run, but help reduce them in the longer run. Second, immigrants can help lower-tier cities move to the fore. The suburbs of Toronto, for example, have seen much of their growth driven by Asian in-migration, and longer term that will give Canadians more residential (and commercial) options.

事实上，移民可以帮助解决这个问题。首先，移民本身可能会促使被接纳国放开房地产市场。因此，移民可能会在短期内增加房地产成本，但从长远来看却有助于降低房地产成本。其次，移民可以帮助低级城市崛起。例如，多伦多郊区的大部分增长都是由亚洲移民推动的，从长远来看，这将为加拿大人提供更多的住宅（和商业）选择。
