An investigation found Qin had an affair while serving as the US ambassador that could have endangered national security, the Wall Street Journal reported, though no inquiry has been announced.

据《华尔街日报》报道，一项调查发现，秦在担任美国大使期间有外遇，可能危及国家安全，但目前尚未宣布任何调查。

Qin’s downfall came as Chinese leader Xi Jinping embarked on a sweeping purge of the military, which included sacking then defense minister Li Shangfu in October. That graft probe ensnared more than a dozen senior defense officials over some six months, in what may be China’s largest crackdown on its armed forces.

秦的下台正值中国领导人习近平开始对军队进行全面整顿之际，其中包括在 10 月份解除时任国防部长李尚福的职务。在大约六个月的时间里，十多名高级国防官员被卷入这场贪腐调查，这可能是中国对军队进行的最大规模的镇压。

The lack of transparency about Qin and the situation in the military have added to investor worries about China’s opaque decision-making as the world’s second-largest economy grapples with a slowdown that’s now among the reasons the stock market is sliding.

在世界第二大经济体努力应对经济放缓之际，秦国和军方情况的不透明加剧了投资者对中国决策不透明的担忧，这也是股市下滑的原因之一。
