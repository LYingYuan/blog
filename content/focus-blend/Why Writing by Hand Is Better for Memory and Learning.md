A steady stream of research continues to suggest that taking notes the traditional way—with pen and paper or even stylus and tablet—is still the best way to learn, especially for young children.

源源不断的研究表明，传统的笔记方式--用笔和纸，甚至是手写笔和平板电脑--仍然是最好的学习方式，尤其是对幼儿而言。

“When you are typing, the same simple movement of your fingers is involved in producing every letter, whereas when you’re writing by hand, you immediately feel that the bodily feeling of producing A is entirely different from producing a B,” van der Meer says. She notes that children who have learned to read and write by tapping on a digital tablet “often have difficulty distinguishing letters that look a lot like each other or that are mirror images of each other, like the b and the d.”

"范德梅尔说："当你打字时，你手指的简单移动就能写出每个字母，而当你手写时，你会立即感觉到写出 A 和写出 B 的身体感觉完全不同。她指出，那些通过敲击数字平板电脑来学习读写的儿童 "通常很难分辨出那些看起来很像或互为镜像的字母，比如 b 和 d"。

Vinci-Booher says the new study opens up bigger questions about the way we learn, such as how brain region connections change over time and when these connections are most important in learning. She and other experts say, however, that the new findings don’t mean technology is a disadvantage in the classroom. Laptops, smartphones and other such devices can be more efficient for writing essays or conducting research and can offer more equitable access to educational resources. Problems occur when people rely on technology too much, Sivashankar says. People are increasingly delegating thought processes to digital devices, an act called “cognitive offloading”—using smartphones to remember tasks, taking a photo instead of memorizing information or depending on a GPS to navigate. “It’s helpful, but we think the constant offloading means it’s less work for the brain,” Sivashankar says. “If we’re not actively using these areas, then they are going to deteriorate over time, whether it’s memory or motor skills.”

Vinci-Booher 说，这项新研究为我们的学习方式提出了更大的问题，比如大脑区域的连接是如何随着时间的推移而变化的，以及这些连接在什么时候对学习最重要。不过，她和其他专家表示，新发现并不意味着技术在课堂上是劣势。笔记本电脑、智能手机和其他此类设备可以更有效地撰写论文或进行研究，并能更公平地获取教育资源。西瓦桑卡尔说，如果人们过于依赖技术，就会出现问题。人们越来越多地将思考过程委托给数字设备，这种行为被称为 "认知卸载"--使用智能手机来记忆任务，用拍照来代替记忆信息，或者依靠全球定位系统来导航。"西瓦桑卡尔说："这很有帮助，但我们认为，不断卸载意味着大脑的工作量减少了。"如果我们不积极使用这些区域，那么随着时间的推移，它们就会退化，无论是记忆还是运动技能。
