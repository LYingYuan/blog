1. Let people feel their feels.
2. Check your own emotions.
3. Talk to children as if they are people.
4. Don’t give advice. Not really.
5. Don’t relate.
6. Ask questions.


This is a skill that need not be rare. After all, one unquestionably unique human attribute—that no other animal seems to be capable of—is the desire to link our minds. We want to know what the other is thinking. We want to know what our whole species thinks (written language) and has learned (school). And yet, minds are not directly observable. We have to talk about them. We have a seemingly endless interest in stories, because there is information there we crave—how to be. Sharing stories of events and people, whether real or fictional, synchronizes our values, provides (perceived) control over this insane world via meaning and causal explanations, and creates—not reinforces, but creates—the basic, primal social bond humans have as we, as listeners, all tune into to one point of attention.

这种技能并不罕见。毕竟，人类有一个毋庸置疑的独特属性--其他动物似乎都不具备--那就是将我们的思想联系起来的欲望。我们想知道对方在想什么。我们想知道我们整个物种在想什么（书面语言），学了什么（学校）。然而，思想是无法直接观察到的。我们必须谈论它们。我们似乎对故事有着无尽的兴趣，因为那里有我们渴望的信息--如何成为一个人。分享事件和人物的故事，无论是真实的还是虚构的，都能同步我们的价值观，通过意义和因果关系的解释，提供（感知）对这个疯狂世界的控制，并创造--不是加强，而是创造--人类基本的、原始的社会纽带，因为我们作为听众，都在关注一个点。

One reason is this myth: that the good listener just listens. This egregious misunderstanding actually leads to a lot of bad listening, and I’ll tell you why: because a good listener is actually someone who is good at talking.

其中一个原因就是这个神话：好的倾听者只是倾听。这个严重的误解实际上导致了很多糟糕的倾听，我来告诉你为什么：因为一个好的倾听者实际上是一个擅长说话的人。

But, the first step in getting over an emotion is to own it.

但是，克服情绪的第一步就是拥有它。

END this moment with “I’ll be up for talking another time about this if you want.” Don’t say “…when you are less angry.” It will make the person angrier.

以 "如果你愿意，我愿意下次再谈这个问题 "结束这一刻。不要说"......等你不那么生气的时候"。这会让对方更生气。

Really put your foot down that you won’t engage. Don’t allow lies you want to correct, or generalizations you want to protest, or insults you want to decry, or any angry words to manipulate you into engaging. This is not a real conversation. Real conversations and problem solving don’t happen in yells or insults.

真正放下身段，不参与其中。不要让你想纠正的谎言、你想抗议的概括、你想谴责的侮辱或任何愤怒的言辞操纵你参与其中。这不是真正的对话。真正的对话和问题的解决不会发生在吼叫或侮辱中。

Ask instead what the child is interested in now—favorite books, hobbies, subjects in school, etc. If it’s a female child, be aware of avoiding remarks on only her appearance or clothing. If you only heard compliments on your hair or dress or whatever from everyone you met, you’d start to think your looks are your most important feature, too. Maybe your only important feature.

询问孩子现在对什么感兴趣--最喜欢的书、爱好、学校科目等。如果是女生，要注意避免只对她的外表或衣着说三道四。如果你遇到的每个人都夸奖你的发型或衣着，你也会开始认为自己的外表是最重要的特征。也许这是你唯一重要的特征。

If it’s a male child, try an unguided, open-ended invitation like “what’s on your mind today, buddy?” What a different world we’d live in if more boys felt safe sharing feelings, in their own way, right from the start.

如果是男孩子，可以尝试不加引导、开放式的邀请，比如 "你今天在想什么，小家伙？"如果有更多的男孩从一开始就能安全地以自己的方式分享感受，那么我们生活的世界将会多么不同。

Come to think of it, every single person you know could use a “**what’s on your mind today, buddy?**” once in a while.

仔细想想，你认识的每一个人都可以偶尔说一句 "**你今天在想什么，伙计？**"。

There are two reasons a person redirects the conversation/attention back to himself: (1) the person is deeply self-centered and incapable of processing information about anyone unless it relates to him. It’s likely this person is cripplingly insecure, and therefore his worry about himself has turned into his only functioning pathway to the world. Or possibly this person is a sociopath. (2) The person really thinks this is helpful to compare stories. The person thinks this is empathy. It isn’t. The time for your story is not now. Just say, “Oh man, that must have really hurt!” Then, try this: look at the person in the eyes. If you can’t stop thinking about yourself, know that you have a problem. Your self-centeredness renders you incapable of intimacy. Get help.

一个人把话题/注意力转回到自己身上有两个原因：（1）这个人深深地以自我为中心，无法处理关于任何人的信息，除非这些信息与他有关。这个人很可能极度缺乏安全感，因此他对自己的担忧成了他与世界沟通的唯一途径。或者，这个人可能是个反社会者。(2) 这个人真的认为比较故事很有帮助。这个人认为这是移情。其实不然。现在不是讲故事的时候。你只需说："哦，天哪，那一定很痛！"然后，试着这样做：看着对方的眼睛。如果你无法停止思考自己，那就说明你有问题。你的自我中心让你无法与人亲密接触。寻求帮助。

Empathy is not “hey that happened to me too!” or “I also know what you are talking about—in fact I know a lot more than you do!” This is more like someone has just brought out his bowling pins to juggle but you grab them and juggle obliviously away from him. Not empathy.

同理心不是 "嘿，我也遇到过这种事！"或 "我也知道你在说什么--事实上，我比你知道得更多！"这更像是有人刚拿出他的保龄球瓶来玩杂耍，你却抓起它们，忘乎所以地从他身边走过。这不是换位思考。

Empathy is just the opposite: turning away from your ego, for just a minute (don’t worry, you can have it back soon!) in order to imagine, really imagine, what it’s like for someone else to be alive.

同理心恰恰相反：从自我中抽离出来，只需一分钟（别担心，你很快就能恢复自我！），以便想象，真正地想象，别人活着是什么样子。

Ask “What happened?” “What kind of place was that?” “When did you first…?” or other non yes-or-no questions. And, this sounds a little counterintuitive, but don’t ask a lot of “why” questions. Asking why can lead to defensiveness, and a sort of shallow string of quick justifications for behavior that aren’t actually insightful or productive. You can sit for days and discuss whys without any real benefit or helpful solutions. Also, it can often just be a dead-end question. “I dunno” is likely what you’ll get out of asking why 99% of the time.

问 "发生了什么事？""那是个什么样的地方？"你第一次......是什么时候？"或其他非 "是 "或 "否 "的问题。还有，这听起来有点违背直觉，但不要问太多 "为什么 "的问题。问 "为什么 "会让人产生防卫心理，并为自己的行为做出一连串肤浅的、快速的辩解，而这些辩解实际上并不具有洞察力或成效。你可能会坐上好几天，讨论 "为什么"，却没有任何真正的益处或有用的解决方案。而且，这往往只是一个死胡同问题。99% 的情况下，"我不知道 "很可能就是你问 "为什么 "的结果。
