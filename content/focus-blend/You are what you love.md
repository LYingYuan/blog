his belief steers me towards believing that there has to be a clear emotional foundation on how we work. To be great, to achieve things, and to provide, we have to convert emotions into outcomes. Rather than the analytical brain being the fuel, it seems it’s more of a catalyst.

这种信念引导我相信，我们的工作方式必须有明确的情感基础。要想成为伟大的人，要想成就一番事业，要想有所作为，我们就必须将情感转化为成果。与其说分析型大脑是燃料，倒不如说它是催化剂。

Emotion cannot be separate from work. It has to be a part of it. When working, you’re expressing yourself. You express beliefs, opinions, and strategies, world views. You cannot detach yourself completely from work. I doubt that you ever should.

情感不能与工作分离。它必须是工作的一部分。工作时，你在表达自己。你在表达信仰、观点、策略和世界观。你不能把自己完全从工作中剥离出来。我怀疑你是否应该这样做。
