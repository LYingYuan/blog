Globally, 4.4% of children die before they are 15 years old. This is the data for 2021, the latest available year.

全球有 4.4% 的儿童在 15 岁前死亡。这是 2021 年的数据，也是最新的数据。

This means that 5.9 million children die every year – 16,000 children on any average day and 11 children every minute.

这意味着每年有 590 万儿童死亡，平均每天有 16,000 名儿童死亡，每分钟有 11 名儿童死亡。

Clearly, a world where thousands of tragedies happen every single day is awful.

显然，一个每天都发生成千上万起悲剧的世界是可怕的。

Data can help to bring the scale of change to mind. Historians estimate that in the past, around half of all children died. This was true no matter where in the world a child was born.

数据可以帮助人们了解变革的规模。据历史学家估计，过去大约有一半的儿童夭折。无论孩子出生在世界哪个角落，情况都是如此。

It’s hard to imagine, but child mortality in the very worst-off places today is much better than anywhere in the past. Even in the world’s richest countries, the mortality of children was much higher very recently. In Niger, the country with the highest mortality today, about 14% of all children die.4 Just a few generations ago, the mortality rate was more than three times as high, even in the best-off places.

很难想象，今天最贫困地区的儿童死亡率比过去任何地方都要好得多。即使在世界上最富裕的国家，最近的儿童死亡率也要高得多。在今天死亡率最高的国家尼日尔，约有 14% 的儿童死亡。4 就在几代人之前，即使在最富裕的地方，死亡率也要高出三倍以上
