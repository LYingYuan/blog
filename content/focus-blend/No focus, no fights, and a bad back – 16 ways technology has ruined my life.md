There are probably hundreds of ways in which ­technology has ruined my life. But let’s start with 16 of them.

1. It’s destroying my concentration
2. It’s destroying my posture
3. Life sometimes feels like an unending struggle to prove I’m not a robot
4. It has rendered meetings inescapable
5. I’m no longer able to have arguments in pubs
6. I find it increasingly hard to turn things on
7. It's given me unfiltered access to the opinions of stupid people
8. It's given stupid people unfiltered access to each other's opinions
9. I am demonstrably worse at typing than I was 10 years ago
10. I feel a strange obligation to monitor bad news in real time
11. I live in fear of being scammed
12. I'm forced to live in silent, shameful defiance of all the accepted wisdom regarding passwords
13. It's created a requirement to go everywhere forewarned and forearmed
14. I have consistently risen to the level of disorganisation that any new technology allows
15. As much as I resent technology, I am helpless without it
16. The rest of the world is also helpless without it

Weirdly, the virtual world is full of old-fashioned mechanical emulators – animated buttons that make a clicking sound; knobs and sliders you can manipulate with your cursor – while in the realm of actual stuff the controls have been reduced to flat black panels covered with inscrutable symbols: a crescent moon; a lightning bolt; a circle with an M inside, where M stands for Mode.

奇怪的是，虚拟世界里到处都是老式的机械模拟器--会发出咔哒声的动画按钮；可以用光标操纵的旋钮和滑块--而在实际的东西领域里，控制装置已经变成了黑色的平板，上面布满了难以捉摸的符号：一个新月；一个闪电；一个里面有一个 M 的圆圈，M 代表模式。

I don’t know about you, but when I’m given advice about not writing passwords down, not using the same password over and over, and changing passwords regularly, I nod and say, “Of course”, but I think: “What, are you kidding?” I write all my passwords down, use as few as I can get away with and change them only when I’m forced to. To me, all the accepted wisdom about passwords ignores one major point: **a password is of no use to me if I don’t know it.**

我不知道你是怎么想的，但当有人建议我不要记下密码、不要重复使用同一个密码以及定期更改密码时，我会点头说 "当然"，但心里却在想："什么，你在开玩笑吗？我把所有密码都写下来，能少用就少用，只有在迫不得已的情况下才更改密码。对我来说，所有关于密码的公认智慧都忽略了一个要点：**如果我不知道密码，密码对我来说就没有任何用处。**

One sometimes hears of inventions that seem designed to foster slavish dependency – self-tuning guitars, programmable cocktail-making machines – but we’re only really reminded of how much territory we’ve ceded to technology when it breaks down. It’s not just that I’ve lost the skills required; it’s that I can’t even recall the process. How did I used to find my way around, or figure out what to watch on TV, or pay for a takeaway? There must have been systems in place.

人们有时会听说一些发明似乎是为了培养对技术的依赖性--自动调谐吉他、可编程鸡尾酒调制机--但只有当技术出现故障时，我们才会真正意识到自己让给了技术多少地盘。我不仅失去了所需的技能，甚至连过程都想不起来了。我过去是如何找到自己的路，或想出看什么电视，或支付外卖费用的？肯定是有系统的。
