“People opt out of the quest for power” often because they see bad people seeking it or using it for ill.

"人们选择放弃对权力的追求"，往往是因为他们看到坏人寻求权力或利用权力为非作歹。

Prof Pfeffer is not one to sugar coat his messages. He has spent a lifetime getting his disciples, at Stanford and elsewhere, to accept what he calls the brutal realities: playing politics is fundamental to getting anywhere at work. Interestingly, resistance to this message is widespread — people prefer what he deems the soothing idea that the light of great work will shine, even under a bushel.

普费弗教授不喜欢给自己的信息涂脂抹粉。他用毕生精力让斯坦福大学和其他地方的弟子们接受他所谓的残酷现实：玩弄政治是在工作中取得成功的根本。有趣的是，人们普遍抵制这一信息--人们更愿意接受他认为是安抚人心的观点，即伟大工作的光芒即使在灯罩下也会闪耀。

Making yourself and your achievements as visible as possible, projecting confidence and authority, and making sure you network, network, network: you have to become an invaluable conduit and contact.

尽可能地展示自己和自己的成就，表现出自信和权威，以及确保你的人脉、人脉、人脉：你必须成为一个不可多得的渠道和联系人。

Hiding from the trade-offs you are already making will send you straight back to that pity party.

逃避或否认在工作场所政治中所做的权衡和妥协是不可取的。

Very few can eat or shelter under their ideals.

很少有人能在自己的理想下衣食无忧。

And having to negotiate between your own and other people’s agendas is just part of adult life.

成人生活的一部分就是要在自己和他人的议程之间进行协商。
