Self-worth is our set of core beliefs about our value as a human being. It’s how we see ourselves and who we perceive ourselves to be. People differ in what they believe they must be or do to have worth or value. When we externalize our self-worth, we get emotionally and chemically rewarded when we succeed. This inevitably turns into a never-ending loop in pursuit of instant gratification. To undo this, we need to develop an awareness of where our self-worth is internally anchored.

自我价值是我们对自身价值的一套核心信念。它是我们如何看待自己以及我们认为自己是什么样的人。人们认为自己必须成为什么样的人或做什么样的事才有价值，这一点各不相同。当我们将自我价值外化时，我们就会在成功时获得情感和化学奖励。这不可避免地会变成一个追求即时满足的永无止境的循环。要消除这种情况，我们需要意识到自我价值的内在依托。

The desire to know that we are okay shows up in every area of life where uncertainty lurks. The delivery room. The boardroom. The bedroom. The classroom. When we are scared, unsettled, and confused, we either look inside ourselves for the answer, or we look outside ourselves to the perceived authority, to the opinions of others. 

在生活中潜伏着不确定性的每一个领域，我们都渴望知道自己没有问题。产房。会议室卧室教室。当我们感到恐惧、不安和困惑时，我们要么向自己的内心寻求答案，要么向外寻求所谓的权威和他人的意见。

When your self-worth is contingent upon success or failure in a particular area, your primary drive often becomes proving to yourself, and others, that you meet those conditions of worth.

当你的自我价值取决于某一领域的成败时，你的主要动力往往是向自己和他人证明你符合这些价值条件。

By externalizing our self-worth, we find ourselves in a never-ending loop in pursuit of it. We become trapped when our self-worth is a consequence, rather than the cause, of personal achievement. In this construct, our self-worth is sustained by successes and achievements and continually threatened by obstacles, failures, and the opinions of others.

通过将自我价值外化，我们发现自己陷入了一个永无止境的追求自我价值的怪圈。当我们的自我价值是个人成就的结果而不是原因时，我们就会陷入困境。在这种结构中，我们的自我价值由成功和成就支撑，并不断受到障碍、失败和他人意见的威胁。
