First up, some stats that are as bracing as the January weather outside (not really, I live in Southern California) to kick off our roundup. A full 46% of Americans did not finish a book last year and 5% more read just one, so if you read two books you’re in the top half of American readers. If you read more than fifty, congrats you’re a book one per-center! Meanwhile, 42% read on paper, 22% digital, and 19% audiobooks, with e-books attracting the heaviest readers.

首先，让我们来看看一些数据，这些数据就像一月的室外天气一样令人振奋（不尽然，我住在南加州），为我们的综述拉开序幕。去年，46% 的美国人没有读完一本书，还有 5% 的人只读了一本书。如果你读了五十多本书，那么恭喜你，你是一本书的读者！同时，42% 的人阅读纸质书，22% 的人阅读电子书，19% 的人阅读有声书，其中电子书吸引了最多的读者。

Lincoln Michel dives a level below the stats and notes that while it’s a tad obscured how they categorize the genres, a quite robust 12% of readers read literary fiction–the same as the number that read science fiction and more than the 11% who read romance–puncturing some of the “we write books people actually read” sneers among certain genre enthusiasts.

林肯 - 米歇尔（Lincoln Michel）对统计数字进行了深入分析，他指出，虽然他们对类型的分类方法略显模糊，但 12% 的读者阅读文学小说的比例相当高--与阅读科幻小说的比例相同，比阅读言情小说的 11% 的比例还要高--这戳中了某些类型爱好者对 "我们写的书真正有人读 "的讥讽。
