ASML also benefited from strong demand from China last year as chipmakers there rushed to get lithography machines ahead of Dutch export rules meant to hobble Beijing’s semiconductor ambitions. The rise in Chinese demand helped offset the effects of a global chip industry slowdown on ASML, which is the only producer of the equipment needed to produce most advanced semiconductors.

去年，ASML 也受益于中国强劲的需求，因为那里的芯片制造商在荷兰出口规则生效前抢购光刻机，这些规则旨在阻碍北京的半导体雄心。中国需求的增长帮助抵消了全球芯片行业放缓对 ASML 的影响，因为 ASML 是生产最先进半导体所需设备的唯一生产商。

China accounted for 39% of ASML’s sales in the fourth quarter, down from 46% in the previous period. China accounted for only 8% in January to March.

第四季度，中国占 ASML 销售额的 39%，低于上一季度的 46%。1 月至 3 月，中国销售额仅占 8%。

The Dutch manufacturer had licenses to ship three top-of-the-line DUV lithography machines to Chinese firms before this month, when the new restrictions took full effect. However, US officials reached out to ASML late last year to ask them to immediately halt scheduled shipments of some of the machines to Chinese customers, Bloomberg News reported previously, citing people familiar with the matter.

在本月新限制全面生效之前，这家荷兰制造商已经获得了向中国公司运送三台顶级 DUV 光刻机的许可。然而，据彭博新闻社此前援引熟悉内情的人士的话报道，美国官员在去年年底联系了 ASML，要求他们立即停止向中国客户运送部分机器。

ASML, which is already restricted from selling its most advanced extreme ultraviolet machines to China, expects as much as 15% of China sales this year will be affected by the new export control measures.

ASML 已经被限制向中国销售其最先进的极紫外设备，预计今年多达 15% 的中国销售额将受到新出口管制措施的影响。
