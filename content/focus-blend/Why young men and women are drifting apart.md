In much of the developed world, the attitudes of young men and women are polarising. The Economist analysed polling data from 20 rich countries, using the European Social Survey, America’s General Social Survey and the Korean Social Survey. Two decades ago there was little difference between men and women aged 18-29 on a self-reported scale of 1-10 from very liberal to very conservative. But our analysis found that by 2020 the gap was 0.75 (see chart 1 ). For context, this is roughly twice the size of the gap in opinion between people with and without a degree in the same year.

在发达国家的大部分地区，青年男女的态度正在两极分化。经济学人通过欧洲社会调查、美国综合社会调查和韩国社会调查，分析了 20 个富裕国家的民意调查数据。二十年前，在从非常自由到非常保守的 1-10 级自我报告中，18-29 岁的男女差别不大。但我们的分析发现，到 2020 年，这一差距将达到 0.75（见图 1）。这大约是同年拥有学位和没有学位的人之间意见差距的两倍。

Put another way, in 2020 young men were only slightly more likely to describe themselves as liberal than conservative, with a gap of just two percentage points. Young women, however, were much more likely to lean to the left than the right, with a gap of a massive 27 percentage points.

换句话说，2020 年，年轻男性认为自己是自由派的比例略高于保守派，差距仅为 2 个百分点。然而，年轻女性倾向于左翼的比例远远高于右翼，差距高达 27 个百分点。

What is striking, though, is that a gulf in political opinions has opened up, as younger women are becoming sharply more liberal while their male peers are not.

然而，令人震惊的是，政治观点上的鸿沟已经拉开，年轻女性正变得越来越自由，而她们的男性同龄人却并非如此。

In Europe, where many elections offer a wide array of parties, young women are more likely to support the most left-wing ones, whereas young men are more likely to favour the right or even the radical right.

在欧洲，许多选举中都有各种各样的党派，年轻女性更倾向于支持最左翼的党派，而年轻男性则更倾向于右翼甚至激进右翼。

The attitude gap between the sexes is also visible in how they view each other. People in 27 European countries were asked whether they agreed that “advancing women’s and girls’ rights has gone too far because it threatens men’s and boys’ opportunities.” Unsurprisingly, men were more likely to concur than women. Notably, though, young men were more anti-feminist than older men, contradicting the popular notion that each generation is more liberal than the previous one. Gefjon Off, Nicholas Charron and Amy Alexander of Gothenburg University use a Dutch analogy to illustrate the difference between young (18-29) and old (65+) European men. It is as great, on this question, as the gap between the average supporter of Geert Wilders’s radical-right Party for Freedom and the Liberal Democrats.

两性之间的态度差距还体现在他们如何看待彼此。27 个欧洲国家的人们被问及是否同意 "推进妇女和女孩的权利已经走得太远，因为这威胁到了男人和男孩的机会"。不出所料，男性比女性更倾向于表示同意。但值得注意的是，年轻男性比年长男性更反女性主义，这与 "每一代人都比上一代人更自由 "这一流行观点相矛盾。哥德堡大学的 Gefjon Off、Nicholas Charron 和 Amy Alexander 用荷兰的一个比喻来说明欧洲年轻男性（18-29 岁）和老年男性（65 岁以上）之间的差异。在这个问题上，他们之间的差距就像盖尔特 - 威尔德斯（Geert Wilders）的激进右翼政党自由党（Party for Freedom）和自由民主党（Liberal Democrats）的普通支持者之间的差距一样大。

n China pollsters do not ask about voting intentions, but they find a similar divergence between young men and women when it comes to gender roles (see chart 3). Yue Qian of the University of British Columbia and Jiaxing Li of the Shanghai University of Medicine and Health Sciences looked at survey data for 35,000 Chinese people. In their analysis they found that young men were much more likely than young women to agree with statements such as “men should put career first, whereas women should put family first” and “when the economy is bad, female employees should be fired first.”

在中国，民意调查人员并不询问投票意向，但他们发现年轻男女在性别角色方面存在类似的分歧（见图 3）。英属哥伦比亚大学的钱悦和上海医药卫生大学的李家兴研究了 35000 名中国人的调查数据。他们在分析中发现，年轻男性比年轻女性更有可能同意 "男性应该把事业放在第一位，而女性应该把家庭放在第一位 "和 "当经济形势不好时，女性员工应该首先被解雇 "等说法。

Although the men at the top are doing fine, many of the rest are struggling. In rich countries, 28% of boys but only 18% of girls fail to reach the minimum level of reading proficiency as defined by pisa, which tests high-school students. And women have overtaken men at university (see chart 4). In the eu, the share of men aged 25 to 34 with tertiary degrees rose from 21% to 35% between 2002 and 2020. For women it rose faster, from 25% to 46%. In America, the gap is about the same: ten percentage points more young women than men earn a bachelor’s degree.

尽管最上层的人过得很好，但其他许多人却在苦苦挣扎。在富裕国家，28% 的男孩和只有 18% 的女孩达不到测试高中生的 pisa 规定的最低阅读水平。在大学里，女性已经超过了男性（见图 4）。在欧盟，2002 年至 2020 年间，25 岁至 34 岁的男性中拥有高等教育学位的比例从 21% 上升到 35%。女性的上升速度更快，从 25% 上升到 46%。在美国，差距大致相同：获得学士学位的年轻女性比男性多 10 个百分点。

In America, Daniel Cox, Kelsey Hammond and Kyle Gray of the Survey Centre on American Life find that Generation Z (typically defined as those born between the late 1990s and early 2000s) have their first romantic relationship years later than did Millennials (born between 1980 and the late 1990s) or Generation X (born in the decade or so to 1980), and are more likely to feel lonely. Also, Gen Z women, unlike older women, are dramatically more likely than their male peers to describe themselves as lgbt (31% to 16%).

在美国，美国生活调查中心（Survey Centre on American Life）的丹尼尔 - 考克斯（Daniel Cox）、凯尔西 - 哈蒙德（Kelsey Hammond）和凯尔 - 格雷（Kyle Gray）发现，"Z 世代"（通常指 20 世纪 90 年代末至 21 世纪初出生的人）比 "千禧一代"（1980 年至 20 世纪 90 年代末出生的人）或 "X 世代"（1980 年之前的十年左右出生的人）晚几年才有第一段恋爱关系，而且更容易感到孤独。此外，Z 世代女性与年长女性不同，她们比男性同龄人更有可能将自己描述为同性恋者（31% 对 16%）。

Social media, the lens through which young people increasingly view the world, may have aggravated polarisation. First, they let people form echo chambers. When homogenous groups of like-minded people discuss an issue, they tend to become more extreme, as individuals vie for affirmation by restating the in-group’s core position in ever-stronger terms, and denouncing those who dispute it.

年轻人越来越多地通过社交媒体来观察世界，这可能加剧了两极分化。首先，社交媒体让人们形成了 "回声室"。当志同道合的人组成的同质群体讨论某个问题时，他们往往会变得更加极端，因为每个人都会以更强烈的措辞重申本群体的核心立场，并谴责那些对其提出异议的人，从而争夺肯定。
