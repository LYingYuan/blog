Just 4.09 million homes were purchased, the fewest since 1995, as tight supply pushed prices to a new record, the National Association of Realtors said.

全美房地产经纪人协会表示，由于供应紧张将房价推向新的纪录，仅有 409 万套房屋被购买，是 1995 年以来购买量最少的一年。

The median sale price in 2023 climbed 1% over the year, to $389,800 (£307,625), according to the NAR, which publishes the widely tracked report on sales of existing homes, which account for the bulk of purchases in the US.

美国全国房地产经纪人协会（NAR）发布的报告显示，2023 年的中位销售价格较上年攀升了 1%，达到 389800 美元（307625 英镑）。
