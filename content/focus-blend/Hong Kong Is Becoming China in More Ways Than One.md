The first is a tendency toward excess among lower-level officials. On the Chinese mainland, this manifests itself in the form of overzealous policy implementation by local authorities, who fear that acting more moderately and pragmatically could expose them to charges of ideological heresy and political disloyalty to the Communist Party.

首先是下级官员的过度倾向。在中国大陆，这种倾向表现为地方政府过度热衷于执行政策，因为他们担心，如果采取更加温和务实的行动，就会被指控在意识形态上异端邪说，在政治上对共产党不忠。

All too often, these officials over-interpret the intent of top leaders and carry out policies with inordinate zeal, inflicting needless suffering on the Chinese people. The classic — and worst — example remains the Great Leap Forward Famine (1959-1961). In a frenzy to show loyalty to Mao Zedong, the megalomaniac party leader at the time, officials exaggerated the amount of grain their jurisdictions produced. They later seized the food of peasants in order to meet the higher quota for delivery, ultimately causing the deaths of more than 30 million people.

More recently, many Chinese authorities went to extremes to enforce “Covid Zero” restrictions during the pandemic. Truck drivers were even stranded on highways and denied access to food and essential necessities just so officials could keep the virus out of their localities and impress higher ups.

最近，许多中国当局在疫情期间采取极端措施，实施 "零感染 "限制。卡车司机甚至被滞留在高速公路上，无法获得食物和基本必需品，只为了让官员们能将病毒拒之门外，给上级留下好印象。

The second trait Hong Kong seems to be acquiring from Beijing is political paranoia. Party leaders have a habit of seeing more threats than actually exist and making more enemies than necessary. As a result, they are prone to taking costly measures against imaginary foes. That can choke off the civil liberties vital to a normal society without doing much to improve regime security.

香港似乎从北京获得的第二个特征是政治偏执。党的领导人习惯于看到比实际存在更多的威胁，树立比必要更多的敌人。因此，他们很容易对假想敌采取代价高昂的措施。这可能会扼杀对一个正常社会至关重要的公民自由，而对改善政权安全却没有多大帮助。
