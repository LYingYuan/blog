Independent Data Shows China Domestic Travel Surge in 2023

独立数据显示 2023 年中国国内旅游人数激增

Doubts about China’s official investment statistics — which measure spending on things like housing, factories and infrastructure — have been fueled by frequent revisions in recent years, and the latest data implies an unusually large adjustment.

近年来，中国官方投资统计数据（用于衡量住房、工厂和基础设施等方面的支出）频繁被修正，这加剧了人们对中国官方投资统计数据的疑虑，而最新数据则意味着一次不同寻常的大幅调整。

Doubts about China’s GDP data tend to spike when the economy slows, with skepticism peaking after Beijing reported 2022 growth at 3% despite widespread lockdowns. Coronavirus controls that year reduced GDP by 3.9%, according to a forthcoming paper in the China Economic Review based on data from nighttime lights tracked from space.

对中国 GDP 数据的怀疑往往会在经济放缓时激增，在中国政府报告 2022 年经济增长为 3% 之后，怀疑情绪达到顶峰，尽管封锁范围很广。根据即将发表在《中国经济评论》上的一篇论文，基于从太空追踪的夜间灯光数据，当年的冠状病毒控制使 GDP 减少了 3.9%。

Around a decade ago, the “Li Keqiang index” was in vogue, named after China’s former premier, who was cited saying he relied on estimates of electricity use, rail freight volumes and bank loan growth as a proxy for GDP. But it’s fallen out of favor, because China’s economy now consists mainly of services, with heavy industry having a smaller role.

大约十年前，"李克强指数 "曾风靡一时，该指数以中国前总理的名字命名，他曾被引述说，他依靠用电量、铁路货运量和银行贷款增长的估计值来代表国内生产总值。但是，由于中国经济目前主要由服务业构成，重工业所占比重较小，"李克强指数 "已不再受青睐。
