In an unprecedented move, US Special forces troops will be permanently stationed in Taiwan, Republic of China. According to Taiwan's United Daily News (UDN), the American 1st Special Forces Group is deployed for a permanent training mission on the island.

美国特种部队将史无前例地永久驻扎在中华民国台湾。据台湾《联合报》（UDN）报道，美国第一特种部队小组将被派往台湾执行永久性训练任务。

The 1st Special Forces Group is permanently stationed this year at two bases of the 101st Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion, a Taiwanese army special operations force. Some of the US troops are based on Kinmen, a group of Taiwanese-controlled islands 10 kilometers from Xiamen, a Chinese port city. Another group is located on the Pescadores islands off the Taiwanese coast.

第 1 特种部队大队今年长期驻扎在台湾陆军特种作战部队第 101 两栖侦察营的两个基地。部分美军驻扎在金门，金门是台湾控制的岛屿群，距离中国港口城市厦门 10 公里。另一支美军驻扎在台湾沿海的澎湖列岛。
