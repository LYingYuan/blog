For years, economists have used alternative gauges — from electricity consumption to energy imports — to complement their understanding of China’s GDP data and check the picture painted by official reports.

多年来，经济学家们一直在使用从电力消耗到能源进口等其他指标来补充他们对中国 GDP 数据的理解，并检验官方报告所描述的情况。

Various investment banks and research houses supplement their approach with alternative gauges. TS Lombard publishes its own “real GDP index” and this week noted that full-year real GDP growth was “likely as low as 3.6 per cent”.

多家投资银行和研究机构以其他指标作为补充。TS Lombard 发布了自己的 "实际 GDP 指数"，并在本周指出，全年实际 GDP 增长率 "可能低至 3.6%"。
