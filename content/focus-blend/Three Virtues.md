There are three great virtues of a programmer; Laziness, Impatience and Hubris.

程序员有三大美德：懒惰、不耐烦和傲慢。

Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it.

懒惰：懒惰：这种品质让你不遗余力地减少总体能源消耗。它让你写出别人会觉得有用的省力程序，并把你写的东西记录下来，这样你就不用回答那么多有关它的问题了。

Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to.

不耐烦：当电脑偷懒时，你会感到愤怒。这让你编写的程序不仅要对你的需求做出反应，还要真正预测到它们。或者至少是假装预测。

Hubris: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about.

傲慢：让你编写（和维护）别人不愿说坏话的程序的品质。
