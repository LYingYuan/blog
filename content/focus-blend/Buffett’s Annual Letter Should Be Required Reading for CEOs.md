**And if a company can’t explain its business model clearly and concisely, that should probably be a red flag to investors.**

**如果一家公司不能简明扼要地解释其商业模式，那就应该向投资者亮出红旗。**

**There’s a lot of money to be made in doing nothing.**

**什么都不做也能赚大钱。**

**Big rewards don’t always have to come with big risks.**

**高回报并不一定伴随着高风险。**

**When you know your successor, publicly name the person.**Too many companies treat succession planning like a state secret. But due to his age, Buffett has had to address it head-on, naming Greg Abel his heir in 2021. In his annual letter, Buffett reminded investors that Abel is “ready to be CEO Of Berkshire tomorrow.” It will be a big deal whenever Abel takes over, but Buffett has removed some of the mystery and surprise from the transition, quelling investor concerns. Making a CEO handoff as boring as possible should be the goal of every company.

**当你知道你的继任者时，公开说出这个人的名字。**太多公司把接班人计划当作国家机密。但由于年事已高，巴菲特不得不直面这个问题，他指定格雷格 - 阿贝尔为 2021 年的继承人。巴菲特在年度信函中提醒投资者，阿贝尔 "已经做好了明天担任伯克希尔首席执行官的准备"。无论阿贝尔何时接任，都将是一件大事，但巴菲特已经消除了交接过程中的一些神秘感和意外，打消了投资者的顾虑。让首席执行官的交接尽可能无聊，应该是每家公司的目标。

**It pays to bet on the US.**

**押注美国是值得的。**

**Avoid rascals.** When considering a potential investment, who is running the company is just as important to Buffett as its economics. He wants “able and trustworthy managers” — although he notes that this is often tough to discern, and he hasn’t always gotten it right. Here he quotes Hugh McCulloch, the first Comptroller of the United States, who warned national banks to “never deal with a rascal under the expectation that you can prevent him from cheating you.” Buffett writes, “Many bankers who thought they could ‘manage’ the rascal problem have learned the wisdom of Mr. McCulloch’s advice — and I have as well. People are not that easy to read. Sincerity and empathy can easily be faked. That is as true now as it was in 1863.”

**避开无赖。**在考虑一项潜在投资时，对巴菲特来说，谁在管理这家公司与公司的经济效益同样重要。他想要的是 "有能力且值得信赖的管理者"--尽管他指出，这一点往往很难辨别，而且他也并不总是能做到这一点。在这里，他引用了美国第一任主计长休 - 麦卡洛克（Hugh McCulloch）的话，他告诫国家银行 "永远不要指望你能阻止一个无赖欺骗你，而与他打交道"。巴菲特写道："许多自以为可以'管理'好无赖问题的银行家已经领悟到麦卡罗克先生忠告的智慧--我也是。人不是那么容易读懂的。真诚和同情很容易伪造。现在和 1863 年一样。
