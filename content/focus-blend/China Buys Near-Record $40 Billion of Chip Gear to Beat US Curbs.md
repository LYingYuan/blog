Imports of the machinery used to make computer chips rose 14% in 2023 to almost $40 billion — the second largest amount by value on record in data going back to 2015, according to Bloomberg calculations based on official customs data. The increase came despite a 5.5% drop in total imports last year, underscoring the importance that the Chinese government and the nation’s chip industry have placed on becoming self-sufficient.

根据彭博社基于官方海关数据的计算，2023 年用于制造计算机芯片的机械进口额增长了 14%，达到近 400 亿美元，是 2015 年以来有记录的第二大进口额。尽管去年的进口总额下降了 5.5%，但这一增长仍凸显了中国政府和中国芯片行业对实现自给自足的重视

Even before those curbs came into effect, Dutch company ASML Holding NV had canceled shipments of some of its top-of-the-line machines to China at the request of the US government, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. The cancellations came weeks before export bans on the high-end chipmaking equipment came into effect.

据彭博社本月早些时候报道，甚至在这些禁令生效之前，荷兰公司 ASML Holding NV 就已经应美国政府的要求，取消了部分顶级设备对中国的发货。在高端芯片制造设备出口禁令生效前几周，ASML 就取消了对华发货。
