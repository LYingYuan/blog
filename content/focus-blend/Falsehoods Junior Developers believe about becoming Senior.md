Your expertise isn't measured by the knowledge you possess but by your ability to:

衡量专业知识的标准不是你所掌握的知识，而是你的能力：

1. work with uncertainty
2. ask the right questions to get to where you need to be in terms of understanding
3. knowing how to find a solution once you have the understanding

It’s fine to say, “I don’t know,” or “I did not understand that completely; let’s discuss this in more depth.” Technology is a vast, ever-expanding universe. Your job is to solve problems, not to be a know-it-all. As a senior, you're more of an amateur guide who knows how to get from point A to point B rather than an all-knowing guru who has memorized all the world’s capitals.

说 "我不知道 "或 "我没有完全理解，让我们更深入地讨论一下 "是可以的。技术是一个巨大的、不断扩展的宇宙。你的工作是解决问题，而不是万事通。作为一名资深人士，你更像是一名业余导游，知道如何从 A 点到达 B 点，而不是一个熟记世界各国首都的无所不知的大师。

Many junior developers dream of working exclusively with the latest frameworks and tools. However, a senior developer's role often involves maintaining and improving legacy systems. These systems carry the weight of years of business logic, customer data, and operational insights. As a senior developer, you'll find that a significant part of your role involves understanding these systems, figuring out why they’re breaking, and optimizing them to meet current and future demands. While also making sure not to break anything yourself.

许多初级开发人员都梦想着只使用最新的框架和工具。然而，高级开发人员的职责往往涉及维护和改进遗留系统。这些系统承载了多年的业务逻辑、客户数据和运营见解。作为一名高级开发人员，你会发现你的职责中有很大一部分涉及了解这些系统，找出它们损坏的原因，并对它们进行优化，以满足当前和未来的需求。同时还要确保不破坏任何东西。

As you grow in your expertise, you see that bringing change requires time — building a case for your idea that resonates not just on a technical level but also aligns with organizational goals, budgetary limitations, and risk management considerations.

随着专业知识的增长，你会发现变革需要时间--为你的想法建立一个不仅在技术层面上能引起共鸣，而且符合组织目标、预算限制和风险管理考虑的案例。

Building things is just fun; building things that bring benefit to the company is fun and rewarding.

建造东西只是一种乐趣，而建造能为公司带来利益的东西才是乐趣和回报。
