China has increasingly turned to private companies in campaigns to hack foreign governments and control its domestic population.

在黑客攻击外国政府和控制国内人口的活动中，中国越来越多地求助于私营公司。

A local government in southwest China paid less than $15,000 for access to the private website of traffic police in Vietnam. Software that helped run disinformation campaigns and hack accounts on X cost $100,000. For $278,000 Chinese customers could get a trove of personal information behind social media accounts on platforms like Telegram and Facebook.

中国西南部的一个地方政府为访问越南交警的私人网站支付了不到 15,000 美元。帮助开展造谣活动和入侵 X 平台账户的软件售价 10 万美元。中国客户只需支付 27.8 万美元，就能获得 Telegram 和 Facebook 等平台上社交媒体账户背后的个人信息。

The materials, which were posted to a public website last week, revealed an eight-year effort to target databases and tap communications in South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, India and elsewhere in Asia. The files also showed a campaign to closely monitor the activities of ethnic minorities in China and online gambling companies.

这些材料上周被张贴到一个公共网站上，揭示了八年来针对韩国、台湾、香港、马来西亚、印度和亚洲其他地区的数据库和窃听通信的努力。这些文件还显示了一项密切监控中国少数民族和网络赌博公司活动的运动。

The revelations underscore the degree to which China has ignored, or evaded, American and other efforts for more than a decade to limit its extensive hacking operations. And it comes as American officials are warning that the country not only has doubled down, but also has moved from mere espionage to the implantation of malicious code in American critical infrastructure — perhaps to prepare for a day when conflict erupts over Taiwan.

十多年来，中国一直无视或逃避美国和其他国家为限制其广泛的黑客行动所做的努力。美国官员警告说，中国不仅加倍努力，而且已经从单纯的间谍活动转向在美国关键基础设施中植入恶意代码--也许是为了有朝一日在台湾问题上爆发冲突做准备。

In part, the change is rooted in a decision by China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, to elevate the role of the Ministry of State Security to engage in more hacking activities, which previously fell primarily under the purview of the People’s Liberation Army. While the security ministry emphasizes absolute loyalty to Mr. Xi and Communist Party rule, its hacking and espionage operations are often initiated and controlled by provincial-level state security offices.

这一变化的部分原因是中国最高领导人习近平决定提升国家安全部的地位，让其参与更多的黑客活动，而此前这些活动主要由中国人民解放军负责。虽然安全部强调对习近平先生和共产党统治的绝对忠诚，但其黑客和间谍行动往往由省级国家安全办公室发起和控制。

Parts of China’s government still engage in sophisticated top-down hacks, like endeavoring to place code inside U.S. core infrastructure. But the overall number of hacks originating in China has surged, and targets have ranged more broadly — including information about Ebola vaccines and driverless car technology.

中国政府的部分部门仍在进行复杂的自上而下的黑客攻击，比如试图在美国的核心基础设施中植入代码。但是，源于中国的黑客攻击总数激增，目标也更加广泛，包括有关埃博拉疫苗和无人驾驶汽车技术的信息。

Among the information hacked was a large database of the road network in Taiwan, an island democracy that China has long claimed and threatened with invasion. The 459 gigabytes of maps came from 2021, and showed how firms like I-Soon collect information that can be militarily useful, experts said. China’s government itself has long deemed Chinese driving navigation data as sensitive and set strict limits on who can collect it.

在被黑客攻击的信息中，有一个关于台湾公路网的大型数据库，台湾是一个民主岛国，中国长期以来一直声称要入侵台湾。专家说，459 千兆字节的地图来自 2021 年，显示了像 I-Soon 这样的公司是如何收集对军事有用的信息的。长期以来，中国政府一直将中国驾驶导航数据视为敏感数据，并对收集者设置了严格限制。

The revelations gained about Chinese attacks are likely to confirm the fears of policymakers in Washington, where officials have issued repeated, dire warnings about such hacks. Last weekend in Munich, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Christopher A. Wray, said hacking operations from China were now directed against the United States at “a scale greater than we’d seen before,” and ranked them among America’s chief national security threats.

华盛顿的官员们曾多次就此类黑客攻击发出可怕的警告。上周末，美国联邦调查局局长克里斯托弗 - 雷（Christopher A. Wray）在慕尼黑表示，来自中国的黑客攻击行动正以 "前所未有的规模 "针对美国，并将其列为美国的主要国家安全威胁之一。

He became one of the first senior officials to talk openly about Volt Typhoon, the name of a Chinese network of hackers that has placed code in critical infrastructure, resulting in alarms across the government. Intelligence officials believe that the code was intended to send a message: that at any point China could disrupt electrical supplies, water supplies or communications.

他是首批公开谈论伏特 - 台风的高级官员之一。伏特 - 台风是一个中国黑客网络的名称，该网络在关键基础设施中植入了代码，引起了整个政府的警觉。情报官员认为，这些代码旨在传递一个信息：中国随时可能中断电力供应、供水或通信。

Some of the code has been found near American military bases that rely on civilian infrastructure to keep running — especially bases that would be involved in any rapid response to an attack on Taiwan.

其中一些代码是在美国军事基地附近发现的，这些基地依靠民用基础设施来维持运转，尤其是在对台湾的攻击做出快速反应时会涉及到的基地。
