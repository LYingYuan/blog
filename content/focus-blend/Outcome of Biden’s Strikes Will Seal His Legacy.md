The first part of that signaling is deterrence. Biden is making clear that anybody who attacks and harms American troops will meet Washington’s wrath. The second is stabilization: Biden does not seek to escalate or widen the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis in the Gaza Strip to the region. In particular, he does not want to launch, or stumble into, a war between the US and Iran.

这一信号的第一部分是威慑。拜登明确表示，任何攻击和伤害美军的人都将遭到华盛顿的愤怒。其次是稳定：拜登并不寻求将加沙地带巴勒斯坦人和以色列人之间的冲突升级或扩大到整个地区。尤其是，他不想发动或陷入美国与伊朗之间的战争。

If these two objectives — deterrence reestablished and escalation avoided — become reality in the coming days, weeks and months, Biden’s first term in the White House will be judged a success. His steady hand at this decisive moment will compensate for the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan early in his presidency and reinforce the stabilizing role he’s played as leader of the Western alliance in supporting Ukraine against the Russian invaders.

如果这两个目标--重新建立威慑和避免局势升级--在未来几天、几周和几个月内得以实现，拜登在白宫的第一个任期将被评为成功。他在这一决定性时刻的稳健表现将弥补美国在其总统任期初期从阿富汗撤军的混乱局面，并加强他作为西方联盟领导人在支持乌克兰反对俄罗斯侵略者方面所发挥的稳定作用。

It’s an open question how long that war would last, whether the mullahs in Tehran would try to build nuclear weapons in a hurry, and whether other enemies of the US, such as Russian President Vladimir Putin or North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, would take advantage of America’s distraction by opening new fronts.

这场战争会持续多久，德黑兰的毛拉们是否会匆忙建造核武器，美国的其他敌人，如俄罗斯总统普京或朝鲜独裁者金正恩，是否会利用美国分心的机会开辟新战线，这些都是未知数。
