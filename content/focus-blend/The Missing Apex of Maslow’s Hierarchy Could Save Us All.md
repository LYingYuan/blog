When psychologist Abraham Maslow died, he wasn’t quite finished with his famous hierarchy of human needs.

心理学家亚伯拉罕 - 马斯洛（Abraham Maslow）去世时，还没有完成他著名的人类需求层次理论。

In his later years, he added a new apex to the pyramid: self-transcendence.

在晚年，他为金字塔添加了一个新的顶点：自我超越。

The most serious problems facing humanity aren’t technical: Although engineering our way out of trouble is possible, it can’t happen until we transcend ourselves, seeing beyond our own individual well-being to the needs of us all.

人类面临的最严重问题并非技术问题：虽然通过工程技术摆脱困境是可能的，但除非我们超越自我，超越个人福祉，着眼于我们所有人的需求，否则不可能实现。

Having met our basic needs at the bottom of the pyramid, having worked on our emotional needs in its middle and worked at achieving our potential, Maslow felt we needed to transcend thoughts of ourselves as islands. We had to see ourselves as part of the broader universe to develop the common priorities that can allow humankind to survive as a species.

马斯洛认为，在满足了金字塔底部的基本需求、满足了金字塔中部的情感需求并努力实现自身潜能之后，我们需要超越将自己视为孤岛的想法。我们必须将自己视为更广阔宇宙的一部分，以发展共同的优先事项，使人类能够作为一个物种生存下去。

Maslow saw techniques many of us are familiar with today — mindfulness, flow — as the means by which individuals can achieve the broader perspective that comes with self-transcendence. Given the importance of coming together as a global community, his work suggests that these methods and others like them aren’t just tweaks available for optimizing our minds, but vitally important tools if we hope to continue as a living species.

马斯洛认为，我们许多人今天所熟悉的技巧--正念、流动--是个人实现自我超越所带来的更广阔视野的手段。鉴于全球社会团结一致的重要性，他的研究表明，这些方法和其他类似方法不仅仅是优化我们心智的小技巧，而是我们希望作为一个生命物种继续生存下去的重要工具。
