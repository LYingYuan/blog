The real estate sector's troubles have also revealed issues faced by the country's so-called "shadow banks" which have lent billions of dollar to developers.

房地产行业的问题也暴露了该国所谓的 "影子银行 "所面临的问题，这些银行向开发商提供了数十亿美元的贷款。

The shadow banks operate in a very similar way to traditional banks but are not subject to the same regulations.

影子银行的运作方式与传统银行非常相似，但不受同样的监管。

In November, Chinese officials launched an investigation into "suspected illegal crimes" at one of the country's biggest shadow banks, Zhongzhi Enterprise Group, which filed for bankruptcy and earlier this month.

11 月，中国官员对中国最大的影子银行之一中植企业集团的 "涉嫌违法犯罪 "行为展开调查，该集团已于本月早些时候申请破产。
