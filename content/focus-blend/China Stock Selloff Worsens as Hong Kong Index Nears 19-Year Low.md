The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index fell as much as 2.2%, edging closer to a level unseen since 2005 and making it one of Asia’s worst-performing key indexes. Chinese tech behemoths including Meituan and Tencent Holdings Ltd. led the declines.

恒生中国企业指数跌幅高达 2.2%，逼近 2005 年以来的最低水平，成为亚洲表现最差的主要指数之一。美团和腾讯控股有限公司等中国科技巨头领跌。

The gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong has lost nearly 13% so far this year, while the S&P 500 has gained 1.5%. HSCEI is the worst performer globally among more than 90 equity indexes tracked by Bloomberg.

今年迄今为止，在香港上市的中国股票指数下跌了近 13%，而标准普尔 500 指数则上涨了 1.5%。在彭博社跟踪的 90 多个股票指数中，国企指数是全球表现最差的。

A confluence of factors have driven the swoon in Chinese stocks since 2024 began, ranging from a deepening housing slump to stubborn deflationary pressures, as well as Beijing’s reluctance to use aggressive monetary and fiscal measures to revive growth. Uncertainties about the trajectory of US interest rates, the threat of an imminent selloff in local stock derivatives and concerns about tighter regulatory oversight have added to the pessimism.

自 2024 年开始以来，中国股市暴跌是多种因素共同作用的结果，其中既有不断加深的房地产低迷，也有顽固的通货紧缩压力，还有中国政府不愿采取激进的货币和财政措施来重振经济增长。美国利率走势的不确定性、本地股票衍生品即将大跌的威胁以及对监管趋严的担忧，都加剧了市场的悲观情绪。
