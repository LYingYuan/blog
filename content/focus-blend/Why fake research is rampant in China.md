The scale of the problem is hard to measure, as fraudulent work often goes unnoticed. But it is useful to look at retractions, or when a scientific journal withdraws a study, usually due to suspicions of research misconduct. Papers from China have the fourth-highest retraction rate in the world, according to Nature, a journal (see chart). In a database of some 50,000 retracted studies compiled by Crossref, an American non-profit, and Retraction Watch, a blog, about 46% are from China.

这个问题的规模很难衡量，因为造假行为往往不为人知。不过，我们可以看看撤稿情况，即科学杂志撤销一项研究的情况，通常是由于怀疑存在研究不当行为。据《自然》杂志报道，中国的论文撤稿率在全球排名第四（见图）。在美国非营利机构 Crossref 和博客 Retraction Watch 汇编的约 5 万篇撤稿论文数据库中，约 46% 来自中国。

But punishment alone will not fix the problem, says Shu Fei of Hangzhou Dianzi University. He believes universities should stop rewarding researchers just for publishing lots of papers. In 2020 the government released guidelines to this effect. Still, little has changed, says Mr Shu. Part of the problem, he suspects, is that university leaders are government officials (rather than academics). So they are good at chasing numerical targets, but bad at fostering good science, which is hard to quantify.

杭州电子科技大学的舒飞（音译）说，但单靠惩罚并不能解决问题。他认为，大学不应再仅仅因为研究人员发表了大量论文而给予奖励。2020 年，政府发布了这方面的指导方针。舒先生说，尽管如此，情况并没有什么改变。他认为，问题的部分原因在于大学领导是政府官员（而非学者）。因此，他们善于追求数字目标，却不善于培养难以量化的优秀科学人才。
