The school model focuses on just in case knowledge. You take classes and study textbooks that cram knowledge into you hoping that one day you might find it useful. But that’s not how learning works in the real world.

学校模式注重的是以防万一的知识。你上课、学习课本上的知识，希望有一天你会发现这些知识是有用的。但现实世界中的学习并非如此。

Constantly listening to and checking what other people are doing doesn’t help you stay focused–it just makes you question yourself.

不断地倾听和检查别人在做什么并不能帮助你保持专注，只会让你质疑自己。

As a general rule, the more frequently a site publishes about tactics (marketing, personal finance, weight loss, etc.), the less you should listen to it.

一般来说，一个网站发布战术（营销、个人理财、减肥等）的频率越高，你就越不应该听它的。

We tend towards neomania: overly focusing on the new and shiny, when new and shiny things tend to be the quickest to go and the least likely to be valuable.

过度关注新的和闪亮的东西，而新的和闪亮的东西往往消失得最快，也最不可能有价值。

A safer bet is to see what content has stood the test of time, following the Lindy Rule. Anything that has been around for 50 years will probably be around for another 50 years, but something that’s been around a few days has no proof of staying power.

更稳妥的做法是遵循林迪法则，看看哪些内容经受住了时间的考验。任何已经存在了 50 年的东西可能还会存在 50 年，但存在了几天的东西却无法证明其持久力。

**If it doesn’t answer a specific question you’re currently asking, cover philosophical knowledge, or entertain you, then don’t read it.**

**如果它不能回答你目前提出的具体问题，不能涵盖哲学知识，或者不能给你带来乐趣，那就不要读。**
