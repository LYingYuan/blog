When Nvidia crossed the $2 trillion market cap threshold on Friday, tech bull Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities predicted the party was just starting for artificial intelligence stocks.

上周五，当英伟达（Nvidia）市值突破 2 万亿美元门槛时，Wedbush Securities 的科技大牛丹 - 艾夫斯（Dan Ives）预测，人工智能股票的狂欢才刚刚开始。

By the look of it, billionaire Marc Rowan is happy to be on the opposite side of that trade after his investment firm, Apollo Global Management, warned valuations have surpassed the excesses of the dotcom era.

亿万富翁马克 - 罗文（Marc Rowan）的投资公司阿波罗全球管理公司（Apollo Global Management）警告说，估值已经超过了网络时代的过高水平。

Customers have flooded Nvidia with so many orders for AI inference training chips like the H100 Tensor Core GPU that CEO Jensen Huang must weigh how best to fairly distribute his company’s chips. Microsoft boss Satya Nadella is now looking to get a cut of Nvidia’s action with its own Maia chip, while Tesla CEO Elon Musk admitted he may not have even invested in his high-risk Dojo supercomputer project had he been able to get his hands on enough Nvidia chips.

客户向 Nvidia 大量订购 H100 Tensor Core GPU 等人工智能推理训练芯片，以至于首席执行官黄仁勋必须权衡如何以最佳方式公平分配公司的芯片。微软老板萨蒂亚 - 纳德拉（Satya Nadella）现在正寻求通过自己的 Maia 芯片从 Nvidia 的行动中分一杯羹，而特斯拉首席执行官埃隆 - 马斯克（Elon Musk）则承认，如果他能获得足够多的 Nvidia 芯片，他甚至可能不会投资高风险的 Dojo 超级计算机项目。

Wood told the Wall Street Journal’s Take on the Week podcast recently that she expects Nvidia competitors will soon start to pressure margins at Huang’s company.

伍德最近在《华尔街日报》的 "本周观点 "播客中表示，她预计 Nvidia 的竞争对手很快就会开始对黄仁勋公司的利润率施加压力。
