Aircraft manufacturers have long been aware of the paradox of automation, where an overreliance on automation makes the human in the loop even more critical than before. Modern airline pilots increasingly rely on autopilot systems, but must be experienced enough to know when to intervene if something goes wrong. Blindly following the instruments in this scenario can lead to loss of life. But in a world where more and more basic operational tasks can be offloaded to an AI system, how can we expect the operators of these systems to know when things aren’t right?

飞机制造商早已意识到自动化的悖论，即过度依赖自动化使得人在环路中的作用比以前更加重要。现代航空公司的飞行员越来越依赖于自动驾驶系统，但他们必须有足够的经验，知道何时在出现问题时进行干预。在这种情况下，盲目地按照仪器操作可能会导致生命损失。但是，在一个越来越多的基本操作任务都可以卸载给人工智能系统的世界里，我们怎么能指望这些系统的操作员知道什么时候情况不对呢？

As developers blindly copy and paste code snippets from their generative AI assistant into production environments, their ability to interrogate that work, and fix issues, shrinks.

当开发人员盲目地将生成式人工智能助手中的代码片段复制并粘贴到生产环境中时，他们审查这些工作并解决问题的能力就会下降。

“My very strong intuition is that, at least for the people who actually want to learn this stuff, this is a learning accelerant,” says Willison. “If you're just getting started coding right now, and you're not the kind of person who just cheats, you actually do want to learn things, these are basically rocket fuel for the rate at which you can learn things.”

"威利森说："我强烈的直觉告诉我，至少对于那些真正想学习这些东西的人来说，这是学习的加速器。"如果你现在刚刚开始学习编码，而且你不是那种只会作弊的人，你确实想学东西，那么这些东西基本上就是你学习东西速度的火箭燃料。

**This creates a greater need than ever for developers to be able to not just write code, but interrogate it.** “The critical part of the role is to understand what the code needs to do. What is the expectation? What is the performance requirement? What are the underlying architectural and operational requirements? All of this thinking is integral to software engineering,” Jepsen says.

**因此，开发人员比以往任何时候都更需要不仅能编写代码，还能分析代码。**"开发人员的重要职责是了解代码需要做什么。期望是什么？性能要求是什么？底层架构和操作要求是什么？所有这些思考都是软件工程不可或缺的一部分。
