The four-day workweek is proving to be the gift that keeps on giving.

事实证明，每周四天工作制是一份源源不断的礼物。

Companies that have tried it are reporting happier workers, lower turnover and greater efficiency. Now, there's evidence that those effects are long lasting.

尝试过这种方法的公司都表示，员工更快乐、离职率更低、效率更高。现在，有证据表明，这些效果是持久的。
