As the slump extends, Xi has shown signs of becoming increasingly involved in the nation’s financial and economy policies, including making an unprecedented visit to the central bank late last year.

随着经济衰退的扩大，习近平已显示出越来越多地参与国家金融和经济政策的迹象，包括去年年底破天荒地访问了中央银行。

The measures have shown little success in restoring investor confidence, which has been hurt in recent years by an economic slowdown as well as Xi’s growing control over private enterprise and sweeping crackdowns.

这些措施在恢复投资者信心方面收效甚微，近年来，经济放缓、习近平对私营企业的控制不断加强以及大范围的镇压行动伤害了投资者的信心。

Even with this week’s rebound, equity benchmarks are still among this year’s worst performers among more than 90 global gauges tracked by Bloomberg. The CSI 300 tumbled to a five-year low on Friday and was still down more than 40% from a peak in 2021.

即使本周有所反弹，在彭博社追踪的 90 多个全球指数中，股票基准仍是今年表现最差的指数之一。周五，沪深 300 指数跌至五年来的最低点，与 2021 年的峰值相比，跌幅仍超过 40%。
