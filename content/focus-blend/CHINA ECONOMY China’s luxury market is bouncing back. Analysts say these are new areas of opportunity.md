LVMH results showed that despite some resumption of overseas travel, more of China’s consumers are buying luxury products at home.

路威酩轩集团的调查结果显示，尽管中国消费者的海外旅行有所恢复，但更多的消费者还是在国内购买奢侈品。

The mainland China personal luxury market grew by about 12% last year to more than 400 billion yuan ($56.43 billion), according to consulting firm Bain & Company.

根据咨询公司贝恩公司（Bain & Company）的数据，中国大陆个人奢侈品市场去年增长了约 12%，达到 4000 多亿元人民币（564.3 亿美元）。

In all, about half the leading brands and several niche brands, have rebounded to 2021 sales levels, the Bain report said, without sharing specific names.

贝恩报告称，总的来说，约有一半的领先品牌和一些小众品牌的销售额已回升至 2021 年的水平，但未透露具体品牌名称。

As companies compete for a slice of the Chinese consumer market, one emerging segment is bedding and fine linen.

随着各公司竞相在中国消费市场分一杯羹，床上用品和亚麻制品成为一个新兴细分市场。

At least four investment deals have occurred in that category in the last 18 months, according to PitchBook data. The latest transaction listed was the acquisition in August of Italian luxury bedding company Frette by investors that included Ding Shizhong, the chairman of Chinese sportswear company Anta.

根据 PitchBook 的数据，在过去 18 个月中，至少发生了四起此类投资交易。最近的一笔交易是 8 月份投资者收购意大利豪华床上用品公司 Frette，投资者包括中国运动服装公司安踏的董事长丁世忠。

While U.S. consumers account for well over 40% of the global market for high-end bed and bath textiles, Chinese consumers currently only account for about 5% or less, according to estimates from the Beijing-based consumer research institute of ZWC Partners, a venture capital firm.

据风险投资公司 ZWC Partners 位于北京的消费者研究所估计，美国消费者占全球高端床品和卫浴纺织品市场的 40% 以上，而中国消费者目前仅占约 5%，甚至更少。
