给出的释义是：“中庸之道是指两个对立面之间理想的中间状态”。用更通俗的话说就是：把握住度，不要用力过猛。\n与人交往需要找到中庸之道，在工作、创造中同样需要寻找它。\n举一个简单的例子，我现在的项目部署代码的方式枯燥繁琐，因此我想要制作一个自动化项目部署公司代码到客户的私有云中。此自动化项目的功能可能包括：\n\n在公司内网打包代码为 Docker image；\n拉取该 image 到本地；\n修改 image 名称；\n开启 VPN 并将 image 上传至客户的私有云；\n部署。\n\n逻辑很简单，即操控浏览器 + Terminal 命令，实现两者并将它们联动起来就能接近 100% 的自动化程度。让我这个单纯的 IT 想想，Terminal 就是写几句 Bash 嘛，浏览器操作的话就是制作一个油猴脚本或者扩展嘛。嗯...等等，如何联动 Terminal 和浏览器我似乎没有做过，问问我的老师 ChatGPT，嗯...好像很复杂，需要学习的知识有点多。\n学习曲线陡增让本令人愉悦的创造过程变得痛苦，畏难情绪扑面而来。我不禁问自己：是否 100% 自动化并不是最优解？\n等等，似乎完成 Terminal 部分就能使自动化程度达到 85%，如果将追求中庸之道比作寻找正态分布的峰值，那么或许完成这 85% 即为我的峰值。\n当然，这并不是给畏惧学习新知识做辩解，每个人的精力和耐心都是有限的，更糟糕的是我性子急，为了追求 100% 自动化而大量压缩其他日常学习的时间只为了自动化用鼠标点击几下的动作，这对我来说是一个亏本买卖。\n但对于其他更有经验的人来说，他/她们的峰值并不一定是“85%”。同样，对于我自己来说，这个峰值也不是一成不变的，我被限制于现在的认知和经验，或许某天我的“信息茧房”会变大，大到足以改变这个自动化程序的峰值。\n“中庸之道”是一门平衡艺术，寻找“峰值”并不是一件简单的事情，不仅需要深谙你自身的特点，还需善于统筹现有资源，尽可能列出目前可行的选项，再思考究竟选择哪一个更靠近“峰值”，这同样需要经验。哈哈哈哈，这样看来，追求“中庸之道”的过程本身也需要遵循“中庸”的原则，不能过于草率决断，也不可过分追求寻找到绝对的“峰值”，我们每个人都被自己当下的认知和经验所限制，寻找适合自己的“中庸之道”也是一个不断学习和适应的过程。\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/article/guan-yu-zhong-yong-zhi-dao-de-si-kao/","title":"关于中庸之道的思考"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/article/markdown-example/":{"body":"This

If you read more than fifty, congrats you’re a book one per-center! Meanwhile, 42% read on paper, 22% digital, and 19% audiobooks, with e-books attracting the heaviest readers.\n首先，让我们来看看一些数据，这些数据就像一月的室外天气一样令人振奋（不尽然，我住在南加州），为我们的综述拉开序幕。去年，46% 的美国人没有读完一本书，还有 5% 的人只读了一本书。如果你读了五十多本书，那么恭喜你，你是一本书的读者！同时，42% 的人阅读纸质书，22% 的人阅读电子书，19% 的人阅读有声书，其中电子书吸引了最多的读者。\nLincoln Michel dives a level below the stats and notes that while it’s a tad obscured how they categorize the genres, a quite robust 12% of readers read literary fiction–the same as the number that read science fiction and more than the 11% who read romance–puncturing some of the “we write books people actually read” sneers among certain genre enthusiasts.\n林肯 - 米歇尔（Lincoln Michel）对统计数字进行了深入分析，他指出，虽然他们对类型的分类方法略显模糊，但 12% 的读者阅读文学小说的比例相当高--与阅读科幻小说的比例相同，比阅读言情小说的 11% 的比例还要高--这戳中了某些类型爱好者对 \"我们写的书真正有人读 \"的讥讽。\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/focus-blend/46-of-americans-didn-t-read-a-book-in-2023-this-week-in-books/","title":"46% of Americans didn’t read a book in 2023 (This week in books)"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/focus-blend/a-2024-plea-for-lean-software/":{"body":"Quantity has a quality all of its own.\n数量本身就有一种质量。\nMany security problems are not so much bad code but more bad logic.\n许多安全问题并非源于糟糕的代码，而是源于错误的逻辑。\nWriting has been called the process by which you find out you don’t know what you are talking about.

Cybersecurity experts have unanimously condemned the idea, pointing out that such backdoors would fundamentally undermine encryption and could exploited by criminals, among other issues. While a legal mandate or public agreement would be needed to allow evidence obtained via backdoors to be admissible in court, the NSA has long attempted—and occasionally succeeded—in placing backdoors for covert activities.\n2015 年全年，美国政界人士和联邦调查局局长詹姆斯 - 科米等执法官员公开游说在软件和硬件中插入加密 \"后门\"，让执法机构绕过身份验证，秘密访问嫌疑人的数据。网络安全专家一致谴责了这一想法，指出这种后门会从根本上破坏加密技术，并可能被犯罪分子利用等问题。虽然通过后门获取的证据需要法律授权或公共协议才能被法庭采纳，但美国国家安全局长期以来一直试图为秘密活动设置后门，并偶尔取得成功。\nAlthough the NSA’s effort puzzled crypto experts, documents leaked by Edward Snowden in 2013 proved that the NSA did indeed build a backdoor into Dual_EC_DRBG and paid RSA, a computer security company, to include the compromised algorithm in its software.\n尽管美国国家安全局的努力让密码专家们感到困惑，但爱德华 - 斯诺登在 2013 年泄露的文件证明，美国国家安全局确实在 Dual_EC_DRBG 中建立了一个后门，并付钱给计算机安全公司 RSA，让其在软件中加入被破解的算法。\nAs our lives become more and more dominated by the digital, security experts have become increasingly vocal in their calls for truly secure encryption, and some governments have begun to listen. Holland’s government has agreed not to use backdoors and support open encryption standards, and despite calls to do so in response to the Paris terrorist attacks, France refuses to implement a backdoor mandate. Even former NSA director Michael Hayden has said that backdoors are a bad idea (and he would know). As Apple vs. FBI wends its way through the courts, we are probably far from the end of this public battle. Whatever the results of this landmark case, the NSA’s classified efforts to subvert cryptography will likely continue.\n随着我们的生活越来越被数字化所主宰，安全专家们对真正安全加密的呼声越来越高，一些国家的政府也开始倾听他们的声音。荷兰政府已经同意不使用后门，并支持开放的加密标准，而法国尽管在巴黎恐怖袭击事件中被要求这样做，但仍拒绝执行后门授权。就连美国国家安全局前局长迈克尔 - 海登（Michael Hayden）也说过，后门是个坏主意（他也知道）。随着苹果公司诉联邦调查局案在法庭上的审理，我们可能还远远没有结束这场公众之战。无论这起具有里程碑意义的案件结果如何，美国国家安全局颠覆密码学的机密努力很可能会继续下去。\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/focus-blend/a-brief-history-of-the-u-s-trying-to-add-backdoors-into-encrypted-data/","title":"A Brief History of the U.S. Trying to Add Backdoors Into Encrypted Data"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/focus-blend/an-electrifying-new-ironmaking-method-could-slash-carbon-emissions/":{"body":"Making iron, the main ingredient of steel, takes a toll on Earth’s delicate atmosphere, producing 8% of all global greenhouse gas emissions.

Hastorf and Hadley Cantril, in which students at Dartmouth and Princeton watched a film of a penalty-ridden football game between the two schools. When questioned about what they witnessed, each side’s partisans saw mainly the fouls committed by their opponents.\n高等教育的一个目标必须是训练我们的学生（往往也包括我们自己），使他们不再无休止地重演阿尔伯特-H-哈斯托夫（Albert H. Hastorf）和哈德利 - 坎特里尔（Hadley Cantril）在 1954 年进行的著名实验，在该实验中，达特茅斯大学和普林斯顿大学的学生观看了两校之间一场点球大战的录像。当被问及他们看到了什么时，双方的支持者主要看到了对手的犯规。\nThe university classroom is the place to press students to look for more.\n大学课堂是促使学生追求更多的地方。\nThe difficulty stems, as my Yale Law School colleague Anthony Kronman has accurately noted, from the yielding of universities to the “vocational ideal,” the notion that what’s most important in life is work (together with the wallet), and concomitantly that the purpose of higher education is to inculcate the skills needed to excel in the labor market. In short, college as a path to a better job and a higher income.\n正如我在耶鲁大学法学院的同事安东尼 - 克罗曼（Anthony Kronman）所准确指出的那样，困难源于大学对 \"职业理想 \"的屈服，即认为生活中最重要的是工作（连同钱包），同时高等教育的目的是灌输在劳动力市场中脱颖而出所需的技能。简而言之，大学是通往更好工作和更高收入的道路。\nFor if the purpose of the university classroom is simply to impart information, digital agents will soon perform the task better than experienced teachers, and colleges will find themselves unnecessary, merely duplicative of what students can get at home, cheaply and efficiently.\n因为如果大学课堂的目的仅仅是传授信息，那么数字代理很快就会比有经验的教师更出色地完成任务，而大学将发现自己没有必要，只是重复了学生在家里可以廉价高效地获得的东西。\nThe classroom is, first and foremost, a place to train young minds toward a yearning for knowledge and a taste for argument — to be intellectually curious — even if what they wind up discovering challenges their most cherished convictions. If the behavioral economist George Loewenstein is right that curiosity is a result of an “information gap” — a desire to know more than we do — then the most vital tasks of higher education are to help students realize that the gap always exists and to stoke their desire to bridge it.\n课堂首先是一个培养年轻人渴望知识、喜欢争论--对知识充满好奇--的地方，即使他们最终发现的东西挑战了他们最珍视的信念。如果行为经济学家乔治 - 卢温斯坦（George Loewenstein）的观点是正确的，即好奇心是 \"信息鸿沟 \"的结果--一种比我们知道得更多的欲望，那么高等教育最重要的任务就是帮助学生认识到鸿沟始终存在，并激发他们弥合鸿沟的欲望。\nImpediments to free speech are impediments to free thought and can only interfere with that search. That’s why academic freedom is so precious.\n对言论自由的阻碍就是对自由思想的阻碍，只会干扰这种探索。这就是学术自由如此珍贵的原因。\nBut I’m not at all sure the college classroom should be a place of comfort. It should be a place, rather, where students regularly face the challenge of difficult questions, as their professors help prepare them for the life of the mind. The more successful the teaching, the more students will carry their taste for the give-and-take of argument out of the classroom and into the larger world.\n但我一点也不确定大学课堂应该是一个舒适的地方。相反，它应该是一个让学生经常面对难题挑战的地方，因为他们的教授会帮助他们为思想生活做好准备。教学越成功，学生们就越能将他们对争论的喜好带出课堂，带入更广阔的世界。\nWhat campuses need is less regulation of speech, not more.\n校园需要的是减少而不是增加对言论的管制。\nI agree with the philosopher Seana Valentine Shiffrin that when we search for the justifications for free speech, we tend to overlook its value in crafting our own identities, the way that a self can try on ideas like clothes, to discover which fit best. Sometimes the ideas will be beautiful; sometimes they’ll be ugly; sometimes they’ll look better on one person than another.\n我同意哲学家西娜 - 瓦伦丁 - 希夫林（Seana Valentine Shiffrin）的观点，当我们为言论自由寻找理由时，我们往往忽视了它在塑造我们自身身份方面的价值，即一个人可以像试穿衣服一样试穿各种想法，以发现哪件最合身。有时候，这些想法会很美；有时候，它们会很丑；有时候，它们穿在一个人身上会比穿在另一个人身上更好看。\nThis process of testing ideas should be encouraged, particularly among the young. But it carries risks, not least because of what we might call influencers, who wind up dictating which ideas it’s fashionable to wear and which should be tossed out. When large majorities of college students report pressure to self-censor, this is what they’re talking about. Surveys suggest that the principal reason students keep controversial ideas to themselves is to avoid the disdain not of their professors but of their peers.\n这种检验想法的过程应该受到鼓励，尤其是在年轻人中间。但它也有风险，尤其是因为我们可以称之为 \"影响者 \"的人，他们最终会决定哪些想法是时髦的，哪些应该被抛弃。当大多数大学生表示有自我审查的压力时，他们说的就是这种情况。调查显示，学生们之所以对有争议的观点守口如瓶，主要是为了避免遭到教授和同学们的鄙视。\nBut I didn’t want to see him punished. I wanted to see him refuted.\n但我不想看到他受到惩罚。我想看到他被驳倒。\nInterrupting classes, making noise so that others can’t hear speakers, blocking access, taking over buildings — all of these are less acts of dissent than assertions of raw power.\n打断课堂、制造噪音让别人听不到演讲、阻塞通道、占领教学楼--所有这些与其说是异议行为，不如说是原始权力的宣示。\nA student who takes an ugly position should be tolerated. A student who tries to prevent someone else’s ugly position from being heard should be suspended.\n对持丑恶立场的学生应该宽容。试图阻止别人表达丑陋立场的学生应该被停学。\nOn campus, at least, you should be able to support Israel in the Gaza War, yet feel free to argue that the Israelis have prosecuted the conflict too aggressively; or to support the aspirations of the Palestinians, yet be willing to condemn unequivocally Oct. 7.\n少在校园里，你应该能够在加沙战争中支持以色列，但也可以认为以色列在冲突中表现得过于激进；或者支持巴勒斯坦人的愿望，但也可以毫不含糊地谴责 10 月 7 日的行动。\nHanging out only with those they already agree with is one of the worst ways for young people to waste their years on campus.\n只与自己已经认同的人来往，是年轻人在校园里虚度光阴的最糟糕方式之一。\nShould the scope of campus debate be unlimited? Of course not. There will of necessity always be a palisade marking the boundary line of civilized conversation, and some opinions will always rest in the wilderness beyond freedom’s protection.\n校园辩论的范围应该是无限的吗？当然不是。在文明对话的边界线上，必然会有一道栅栏，而有些观点总是处于自由保护之外的荒野之中。\nI’ve argued elsewhere that each generation should be permitted to place, at most, one issue beyond the fence. I believe it still. But that exclusion should follow, not precede, the waves of social change. Especially today, as the world teems with ferment, as every activist left or right pushes to move this issue or that outside the universe of rational discourse, the academy must be the last to yield.\n我曾在其他地方论证过，每一代人最多只能将一个问题置于栅栏之外。我现在仍然这么认为。但是，这种排斥应该在社会变革的浪潮之后，而不是之前。尤其是在今天，当世界充斥着各种发酵，当每一个左翼或右翼的激进分子都在推动将这个或那个问题置于理性讨论的范围之外时，学术界必须是最后一个让步的。\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/focus-blend/college-is-all-about-curiosity-and-that-requires-free-speech/","title":"College Is All About Curiosity.

Although he often praised Xi Jinping as president and signed a 2020 trade deal with China, Trump now repeatedly bashes Beijing on the campaign trail and has promised a tougher stance than President Biden.\n两党的经济学家都表示，所有这些选择都将对美国和全球经济造成巨大破坏，其影响将远远超过特朗普第一任期的贸易战。虽然特朗普在担任总统期间经常称赞习近平，并与中国签署了 2020 年贸易协议，但现在他在竞选活动中一再抨击中国政府，并承诺采取比拜登总统更强硬的立场。\nhas primarily focused on intensifying policies he pursued during his first term, such as a severe immigration crackdown, cuts to corporate taxes and disruptive new tariffs on U.S. trading partners.\n他的主要重点是强化自己在第一任期推行的政策，比如严厉打击移民、削减企业税以及对美国贸易伙伴征收破坏性的新关税。\nBut Trump’s plans for China may be the most dramatic — and disruptive.\n但特朗普对中国的计划可能最引人注目，也最具破坏性。\n“I took on Communist China like no administration in history, bringing in hundreds of billions of dollars pouring right into our Treasury when no other president had gotten even literally 10 cents out of China,” Trump said in New Hampshire before he won that state’s primary contest. “Nobody even tried. We took in hundreds of billions of dollars.”\n\"在赢得新罕布什尔州的初选之前，特朗普在该州的新罕布什尔州说：\"我像历史上任何一届政府一样打击了共产主义中国，使数千亿美元直接流入我们的国库，而其他任何总统都没有从中国得到过哪怕 10 美分的好处。\"没有人尝试过。我们吸收了数千亿美元\"。\nMost economists say these costs were primarily paid by U.S. consumers and firms, not by China’s government or the Communist Party.\n大多数经济学家表示，这些成本主要由美国消费者和企业支付，而不是由中国政府或中国共产党支付。\nPolicymakers of both parties now argue that China’s economic policies — including artificially devaluing its currency to support exports — have undermined U.S. manufacturing, and Trump sometimes discusses tariffs as a way to force Beijing to change course.\n现在，两党的政策制定者都认为，中国的经济政策--包括人为地使货币贬值以支持出口--损害了美国的制造业，特朗普有时会将关税作为迫使中国政府改弦更张的一种方式来讨论。\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/focus-blend/donald-trump-is-preparing-for-a-massive-new-trade-war-with-china/","title":"Donald Trump is preparing for a massive new trade war with China"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/focus-blend/efficiency-asymmetry-scientists-report-fundamental-asymmetry-between-heating-and-cooling/":{"body":"According to conventional wisdom, a system placed in an environment with a different temperature tends to relax to the temperature of the latter, mediated by the flows of heat or matter that are set solely by the temperature difference. It is becoming clear, however, that thermal relaxation is much more intricate when temperature changes push the system far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, by using an optically trapped colloidal particle, we show that microscale systems under such conditions heat up faster than they cool down. We find that between any pair of temperatures, heating is not only faster than cooling but the respective processes, in fact, evolve along fundamentally distinct pathways, which we explain with a new theoretical framework that we call thermal kinematics. Our results change the view of thermalization at the microscale and will have a strong impact on energy-conversion applications and thermal management of microscopic devices, particularly in the operation of Brownian heat engines.\n按照传统的观点，一个系统被置于不同温度的环境中，会倾向于放松到后者的温度，这完全是由温差所决定的热流或物质流促成的。然而，当温度变化使系统远离热力学平衡状态时，热松弛现象就会变得更加复杂。在这里，我们通过使用光学捕获胶体粒子，证明了微尺度系统在这种条件下升温比降温更快。我们发现，在任何一对温度之间，升温不仅比降温快，而且各自的过程实际上是沿着根本不同的路径演化的。我们的研究结果改变了人们对微观尺度热化的看法，将对微观设备的能量转换应用和热管理，尤其是布朗热机的运行产生重大影响。\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/focus-blend/efficiency-asymmetry-scientists-report-fundamental-asymmetry-between-heating-and-cooling/","title":"Efficiency asymmetry: Scientists report fundamental asymmetry between heating and cooling"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/focus-blend/evergrande-will-be-dismantled-a-big-bang-end-to-years-of-stumbles/":{"body":"The order means that Evergrande, which has been limping along for two years, unable to pay its debts or function normally but still in operation, will now likely face a protracted period dismantling a massive business with projects that span hundreds of cities and unrelated businesses like an electric vehicle company.\n过去两年恒大步履蹒跚，无法偿还债务或正常运转，但仍在运营中。该清盘令意味着，恒大在接下来的一段漫长时期里需要拆分这家公司的庞大业务，其项目遍布数百座城市，还有和房地产不相关的业务，例如电动汽车公司。\nThere isn’t a lot left in Evergrande’s sprawling empire that still has value.

Huizinga defines play as an act of self-directed freedom. It can only really happen when children are left to their own devices, which requires parents to ignore them.\n荷兰文化理论家约翰 - 惠伊辛加（Johan Huizinga）认为游戏是最原始的：就像任何其他年幼的动物一样，儿童有游戏的内在驱动力，不需要教他们如何去做。Huizinga 将游戏定义为一种自主自由的行为。只有让孩子们自己去玩，这才是真正的游戏，这就需要父母不理会他们。\nParents worry that boredom is bad — when actually, it is an important learning experience. It’s a transitional space in which the child realises that she needs to do something differently. She might then try to attract a parent’s attention. If she doesn’t get it, she gets fractious; if she is still ignored, she eventually finds something else to do. If we leave that novelty-seeking impulse to develop, it turns into creativity. It just needs time.\n家长们担心无聊是坏事--而实际上，无聊是一种重要的学习体验。这是一个过渡空间，在这个空间里，孩子意识到她需要做一些不同的事情。这时，她可能会试图吸引父母的注意。如果没有得到关注，她就会变得暴躁；如果仍然被忽视，她最终会找到其他事情做。如果我们让这种追求新奇的冲动发展下去，它就会变成创造力。只是需要时间。\nIn other words, play is a good warm-up for life. But, crucially, it doesn’t take place for material or real-world gain. The goals exist outside of the goals we ordinarily strive for, and they evaporate. Kids need to be emotionally committed enough to want to win, but not so invested that they kick off when they don’t.

It’s easy to get distracted during a conversation. Try to make sure that every question you ask helps you gather either facts or your interlocutor’s opinion. Avoid empty questions to fill the time. Genuinely try to know more about them, and frame your questions accordingly.\nStart by listening. In the classic How to Win Friends and Influence People, Dale Carnegie advised to “be a good listener” and to “ask questions the other person will enjoy answering.” More than eighty years later, his advice still holds true. You can’t ask good questions if you don’t listen to what the person has to say.\nInterrupt wisely. It’s not about never interrupting the person you’re chatting with. It’s about ending fewer sentences with a period, and more with a question mark. Don’t worry about asking the wrong question. Not asking enough is more detrimental to building a relationship than asking one poorly phrased question. That being said…\nUse the right wording. Avoid leading questions and use a neutral tone instead. Refrain hinting at your opinion or the answer you’d like to get. If you want honest opinions or accurate information, don’t prime your interlocutor with loaded questions. Keep them open ended so they have the option of giving you an answer you didn’t expect. (closed questions are often used in manipulative surveys to get the results needed to support a specific agenda)\nBuild a hierarchy. Follow general questions with specific ones, focus your questions so they ask one thing at a time, and use something in the answer you got to frame your next question. This will help the conversation flow more naturally.\n\n以下是五条提问指南：\n\n目标明确：在对话的海洋中，不要迷失方向。每个问题都应该是你探索真相或了解对方观点的桨。避免只为消磨时间而提问，真心实意地探寻对方的世界，使你的问题成为探索之光。\n倾听先行：在《如何赢得朋友和影响他人》（How to Win Friends and Influence People）这本传世经典中，戴尔·卡耐基告诉我们要“成为一名优秀的倾听者”，并“提出让对方乐于回答的问题”。即使时过境迁，这个建议依然有效。不倾听，就无法精准提问。\n智慧打断：这并不是说永远不打断正在和你聊天的人。而是减少句末的句号，多用问号。让对话少一些句号，多一些问号。不要担心问错问题。问得不够比问一个措辞不当的问题更不利于建立关系。\n措辞得当：避免引导性问题，保持语气中立。不要流露出你想听到的答案，如果你追求真实和准确，就别让问题带有预设立场。开放式的问题能带来意想不到的答案。（封闭式问题常见于为了特定目的而设的调查中）\n构建层次：先提出一般性问题，再跟进具体的问题。每次只探讨一个点，用前一个回答作为下一个问题的起点。这样，对话就能像溪流一样自然流淌。\n\nThe most important guideline to remember is simply to ask more questions.\n最重要的准则很简单，那就是多提问。\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/focus-blend/the-alchemy-of-good-questions/","title":"The Alchemy of Good Questions"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/focus-blend/the-missing-apex-of-maslow-s-hierarchy-could-save-us-all/":{"body":"When psychologist Abraham Maslow died, he wasn’t quite finished with his famous hierarchy of human needs.\n心理学家亚伯拉罕 - 马斯洛（Abraham Maslow）去世时，还没有完成他著名的人类需求层次理论。\nIn his later years, he added a new apex to the pyramid: self-transcendence.\n在晚年，他为金字塔添加了一个新的顶点：自我超越。\nThe most serious problems facing humanity aren’t technical: Although engineering our way out of trouble is possible, it can’t happen until we transcend ourselves, seeing beyond our own individual well-being to the needs of us all.\n人类面临的最严重问题并非技术问题：虽然通过工程技术摆脱困境是可能的，但除非我们超越自我，超越个人福祉，着眼于我们所有人的需求，否则不可能实现。\nHaving met our basic needs at the bottom of the pyramid, having worked on our emotional needs in its middle and worked at achieving our potential, Maslow felt we needed to transcend thoughts of ourselves as islands.

Google gets to download all of Medium’s pages, “and in exchange we get a significant amount of traffic. It’s win-win. Everyone thinks that.” This is the bargain Google made with the internet as a whole, to funnel traffic to other websites while selling ads against the search results. And Google has, by all accounts, been a good citizen of robots.txt. “Pretty much all of the well-known search engines comply with it,” Google’s Mueller says. “They’re happy to be able to crawl the web, but they don’t want to annoy people with it… it just makes life easier for everyone.”\n对于大多数网站来说，这是很容易的交易。\"Medium 首席执行官托尼 - 斯塔布宾（Tony Stubblebine）说：\"谷歌是我们最重要的蜘蛛。谷歌可以下载 Medium 的所有网页，\"作为交换，我们获得了大量的流量。这是双赢。每个人都这么认为。这就是谷歌与整个互联网达成的协议，在向其他网站输送流量的同时，还在搜索结果中出售广告。从各方面来看，谷歌都是 robots.txt 的好公民。\"谷歌的穆勒说：\"几乎所有知名的搜索引擎都遵守了这一规定。\"他们很高兴能够抓取网页，但也不想因此惹恼别人......这只是让大家的生活变得更轻松。\nIn the last year or so, though, the rise of AI has upended that equation. For many publishers and platforms, having their data crawled for training data felt less like trading and more like stealing. “What we found pretty quickly with the AI companies,” Stubblebine says, “is not only was it not an exchange of value, we’re getting nothing in return. Literally zero.” When Stubblebine announced last fall that Medium would be blocking AI crawlers, he wrote that “AI companies have leached value from writers in order to spam Internet readers.”\n不过，在过去一年左右的时间里，人工智能的兴起颠覆了这一等式。对于许多出版商和平台来说，让他们的数据被抓取以获取训练数据，感觉不像是交易，更像是偷窃。\"Stubblebine 说：\"我们很快就发现，人工智能公司不仅没有进行价值交换，我们也没有得到任何回报。简直就是零。\"去年秋天，当斯塔伯宾宣布 Medium 将屏蔽人工智能爬虫时，他写道：\"人工智能公司从作家那里攫取了价值，以便向互联网读者发送垃圾邮件\"。\nIt’s not just publishers, either. Amazon, Facebook, Pinterest, WikiHow, WebMD, and many other platforms explicitly block GPTBot from accessing some or all of their websites. On most of these robots.txt pages, OpenAI’s GPTBot is the only crawler explicitly and completely disallowed. But there are plenty of other AI-specific bots beginning to crawl the web, like Anthropic’s anthropic-ai and Google’s new Google-Extended. According to a study from last fall by Originality.AI, 306 of the top 1,000 sites on the web blocked GPTBot, but only 85 blocked Google-Extended and 28 blocked anthropic-ai.\n不仅仅是出版商。亚马逊、Facebook、Pinterest、WikiHow、WebMD 和许多其他平台都明确禁止 GPTBot 访问其部分或全部网站。在这些 robots.txt 页面中，OpenAI 的 GPTBot 是唯一一个被明确完全禁止的爬虫。但也有很多其他人工智能专用机器人开始抓取网络，比如 Anthropic 的 anthropic-ai 和谷歌的新版 Google-Extended。根据 Originality.AI 去年秋天进行的一项研究，网络上排名前 1000 位的网站中有 306 个屏蔽了 GPTBot，但只有 85 个屏蔽了 Google-Extended，28 个屏蔽了 anthropic-ai。\nEven as AI companies face regulatory and legal questions over how they build and train their models, those models continue to improve and new companies seem to start every day. Websites large and small are faced with a decision: submit to the AI revolution or stand their ground against it. For those that choose to opt out, their most powerful weapon is an agreement made three decades ago by some of the web’s earliest and most optimistic true believers. They believed that the internet was a good place, filled with good people, who above all wanted the internet to be a good thing. In that world, and on that internet, explaining your wishes in a text file was governance enough.

(United Nations) 的数据，2022 年，中国占全球制造业的 31%，而美国仅占 16%。\n位于伦敦的 GlobalData TS Lombard 的首席中国经济学家 Rory Green 说，中国政府所青睐的一些制造领域全加到一起，最多可能占到中国 GDP 的 10%。\n“中国经济仍然极其依赖建筑活动，”凯投宏观 (Capital Economics) 驻新加坡的中国经济主管 Julian Evans-Pritchard 说。“中国经济之所以仍在以 5% 的速度增长，并不是因为电动汽车出口蓬勃发展。其体量实在是太小了。”\n这与高盛 (Goldman Sachs) 经济学家的看法不谋而合，据他们计算，未来几年对“新三样”产业的投资将不足以抵消中国面临的更广泛挑战所构成的拖累。在最近的一份报告中，他们估计，即使考虑到对电动汽车、电池和可再生能源领域的巨额投资，房地产行业的持续低迷和传统汽车产量的下降也将对年增长率构成 0.5 个百分点的拖累，直到 2027 年。他们发现，对就业的净影响也将是负面的，因为与现代制造业相比，建筑业往往能吸纳更多就业。该投行预计，今年中国经济的年增长率将放缓至 4.5% 左右，到 2027 年将放缓至 3.7%。\n尽管印度等一些国家正在考虑对某些中国产品实施更严格的限制，以保护本国的新兴产业，但其他国家可能将中国产品视为负担得起的西方高科技产品的替代品。\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/focus-blend/zhong-guo-quan-li-fa-zhan-lu-se-chan-ye-yi-ci-ji-pi-ruan-de-jing-ji/","title":"中国全力发展绿色产业，以刺激疲软的经济"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/now/":{"body":"In
